\chapter{Integrating Factors}
\label{app_integrating}

Start with differential equation of the form:

\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} X(t) + \alpha X(t) &= \beta
\end{align}

Multiply by the integrating factor, then group terms: 

\begin{align}
  \exp (\alpha \; t) \frac{\partial}{\partial t} X(t) + \alpha \exp(\alpha \; t) X(t) &= \beta \exp(\alpha \; t) \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \big[ \exp(\alpha t) X(t) \big] &= \beta \exp(\alpha t)
\end{align}

Integrate from 0 to $\delta t$, assuming that $\beta$ is constant in time or varies slowly. 

\begin{align}
  \int^{\delta t}_0 dt \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \big[ \exp(\alpha t) X(t) \big] &= \int^{\delta t}_0 dt \beta \exp(\alpha t) \\
  \exp (\alpha \deltat) X(\deltat) - X(0) &= \deltat \beta ( \frac{\deltat}{2} ) \exp ( \alpha \frac{\deltat}{2} )
\end{align}

Then rearrange to solve for the new value of X:

\begin{align}
  X(\delta t) &= X(0) \exp ( -\alpha \delta t ) + \delta t \beta ( \frac{\delta t}{2} ) \exp ( -\alpha \frac{\delta t}{2} )
\end{align}

Done.
