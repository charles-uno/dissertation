\chapter{Large Modenumber Effects}
\label{ch_bigm}

This is why we do 2.5D... you can't resolve these effects in a 3D model. It's too expensive. 

\todo{Do we see a difference between \vec{k} (momentum) and the group velocity? Poynting flux will always be pretty much along the field line, since $B_3$ is small and $E_3$ is zero, but the wave vector need not be. This is a question of coupling/converting to compressional waves, I guess. }

\todo{Look at McKenzie and Westphal. Waves incident on the bow shock, etc, at weird angles. }

\todo{Look at the E to B ratio. Compare to the \Alfven speed and to the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity. }

\todo{Look at Mann's poloidal lifetime, $\dd{\omega_A'} \lambda$ where $\lambda \sim \frac{\azm}{2 \pi r}$. }
