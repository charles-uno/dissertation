\chapter{Introduction}
  \label{ch_intro}

The 1850s were a pivotal time in human history. The United States spiraled toward the American Civil War, which would abolish slavery and consolidate the power of the federal government. A slew of conflicts in Southern Europe, such as the Austro-Sardinian War, led to the unification of modern Italy. China was beset by Western powers in the Second Opium War, while simultaneously fighting the Taiping Civil War, one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history. Origin of Species was published, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid, and modern epidemiology was developed in response to a Cholera outbreak in London. 

Ambivalent to these events, the Sun belched out a large CME\footnote{CME stands for Coronal Mass Ejection, an intense burst of particles and magnetic energy from the Sun.} aimed directly at Earth. The resulting geomagnetic storm\footnote{The Solar Storm of 1859 is also called the Carrington Event, after English astronomer Richard Carrington, who drew a connection between the storm's geomagnetic activity and the sunspots he had observed the day before.} caused telegraph systems to fail across the Western hemisphere\cite{green_2006}, and even electrocuted operators. Displays of the northern lights were visible as far south as Cuba. 

A CME of similar size narrowly missed Earth in 2012\cite{nasa_2012}. Had it not, it's estimated\cite{lloyds_2013} that it would have caused widespread, long-term electrical outages, with a damage toll on the order of \num{e9} dollars. 

\todo{The storm of 1859 presented compelling evidence that the Sun drives geomagnetic activity. In the decades that followed, a model took shape to describe the mechanisms of energy transfer between the Sun and the Earth. Based on auroral observations and data from ground-based magnetometers, Birkeland argued for the existence of a constant outflow of electrons and ions from the Sun -- the solar wind. The advent of high-frequency radio communication allowed Kennelly, Heaviside, and others to probe the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere. }

\todo{The study of space weather was revolutionized by the development of sounding rockets and satellites in the mid twentieth century. This allowed direct observation of the structure of the near-Earth environment, including, crucially, the waves that carry energy through it. }

\todo{Not least among these advances was the discovery of \Alfven waves. {\Alfven}ic aurora. Carry energy and particles. }

The study of space weather revolves around the transfer of energy from the Sun to the Earth. Ultra low frequency waves in particular are an important energy transport mechanism between the magnetosphere's outer boundary (at the solar wind) and its inner boundary (at the top of the atmosphere).
