\chapter{Model}
  \label{ch_model}

\todo{The present chapter sketches the fundamental equations of waves in a cold, resistive plasma. It then illustrates the implementation of a two and a half dimensional \Alfven wave code to model those waves. Finally, takes a look at a little something extra that the code might like. }

%``Increasing the Hall conductance allows the energy to oscillate through the inductive process rather than dissipate as Joule heating, increasing the `ringtime' of field line resonances.''\cite{waters_2013}

%Ionospheric profiles are static for the duration of a simulation. Even so-called ultra low frequency waves are still much faster than convective timescales. Each profile is resolved to an altitude of about $\SI{e4}{\km}$, and include well-resolved $E$, $F_1$, and $F_2$ layers.
