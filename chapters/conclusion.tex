\section{Future Work}

Arbitrary deformation of grid. Get $\hat{e}_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial u^i} \underline{x}$, then $g_{ij} = \hat{e}_i \cdot \hat{e}_j$, then invert the metric tensor for contravariant components.  

MPI. Some benchmarks with time to compute vs time to broadcast. At what problem scale does additional parallelization make sense? 

Driving based on events? Wouldn't be that hard. 

Test particles? Seems silly. Watching something drift-bounce resonate will require making assumptions about what's going on on the other face of the planet.
