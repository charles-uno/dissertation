\section{Future Work}

Arbitrary deformation of grid. Get $\hat{e}_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial u^i} \underline{x}$, then $g_{ij} = \hat{e}_i \cdot \hat{e}_j$, then invert. 

MPI. Some benchmarks with time to compute vs time to broadcast. At what problem scale does additional parallelization make sense?
