%ALEX NOTES
%- "precipitates into the atmosphere" what?

%\todo{ULF, FLR, and Pc4 all mean basically the same thing in the context of the present work. How many acronyms do we really need? }

The motion of a charged particle in a dipole field can be described in terms of three fundamental motions. The first is cyclotron motion: a particle orbits around a magnetic field line in accordance with the Lorentz force. The second is bounce motion: while orbiting, the particle moves along the field line like a bead on a wire, back and forth between the northern and southern hemispheres\footnote{As a particle approaches Earth, it experiences an ever-stronger magnetic field. The particle's perpendicular kinetic energy increases in proportion with the magnetic field in order to conserve its first adiabatic invariant. When the perpendicular kinetic energy can no longer increase --- that is, when the parallel kinetic energy is zero --- the particle bounces back. (If the parallel kinetic energy is sufficiently large, the particle doesn't bounce; it precipitates into the atmosphere.)}. The third is drift motion: as particles orbit and bounce, they also move azimuthally around Earth per the gradient-curvature drift. 

Characteristic timescales for each of the above motions depend on particle energy. Electron cyclotron motion is on the order of \todo{$\cdots$} in the ionosphere, and closer to \todo{$\cdots$} in the tail; ions gyrate slower by three orders of magnitude due to their larger mass. \todo{Bounce... Drift... }

%\todo{Electron cyclotron frequency is on the order of $\sim \SI{1}{\MHz}$ in the ionosphere, and more like $\sim \SI{1}{\kHz}$ in the magnetosphere. Much faster than drift or bounce timescales. Ion cyclotron frequency... down by a factor of $\frac{\me}{\mp}$. }

%\todo{Bounce timescales are faster closer to Earth (where the field lines are short) and slower further out. Something like \SIrange{10}{100}{\second}. Bounce timescales depend only on velocity, right? }

%\todo{Drift timescales vary significantly based on particle energy. Dai\cite{dai_2013} showed a nice example of \SI{100}{\kilo\eV} ions drifting with a period of $\sim \SI{100}{\s}$. Bounce and drift timescales can overlap --- this turns out to be important. This doesn't depend on mass, right? Just kinetic energy. }

Wave-particle resonance arises when a particle's periodic motion matches with the frequency of a coincident electromagnetic wave\cite{elkington_1999,mann_2013,ozeke_2008,southwood_1976}. In the particle's rest frame, the wave then appears as a net electric field. This allows a net movement of energy between the wave and the particle. The interaction is analogous to a surfer moving along with --- and being accelerated by --- a wave in the ocean. 

In the present work, the waves in question are field line resonances (FLRs). An FLR is a standing harmonic on a geomagnetic field line. It can also be envisioned as a superposition of traveling waves, reflecting back and forth between its northern and southern foot points at the conducting ionosphere. These waves travel at the \Alfven speed\footnote{The \Alfven speed is given by \va is given by $\va^2 \equiv \frac{B^2}{\mz \rho}$, where $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, \mz is the magnetic constant, and $\rho$ is the mass density of the ambient plasma. It can vary by several orders of magnitude over the length of a magnetic field line. }. The fundamental equations of field line resonance were presented by Dungey in 1954\cite{dungey_1954}; since then, they have remained a topic of active study. 

So-called ultra low frequency waves  --- of which FLRs are a subset --- are categorized by morphology. Continuous (long-lived) pulsations are termed Pc, while irregular pulsations are called Pi. Within each are a number of frequency bands; see \cref{tab_iaga}\cite{jacobs_1964}.

FLRs fall into the Pc3, Pc4, and Pc5 ranges. The present work focuses specifically on the Pc4 band: waves with periods of a minute or two. Frequencies in the Pc4 range typically coincide with \Alfven bounce times\footnote{The \Alfven frequency is the inverse of the \Alfven bounce time: $\frac{2 \pi}{\omega_A} \equiv \oint \frac{dz}{v_A}$. } near the plasmapause: $L\sim4$ to $L\sim6$\cite{anderson_1990,dai_2015,engebretson_1992,liu_2009}\footnote{Not coincidentally, these are the same $L$-shells where the Van Allen Probes spend most of their time; see \cref{ch_rbsp}. }. In fact, the large radial gradients in the \Alfven speed near the plasmapause act as an effective potential well, trapping FLRs\cite{dai_2009,klimushkin_2004,lee_1999,leonovich_2000,mager_2013,takahashi_2010}.

    }
    \label{fig_fa}
\end{figure}

In addition to being radially localized, FLRs in the Pc4 frequency band (also called Pc4 pulsations, or just Pc4s) are localized in magnetic local time (MLT\footnote{Noon points toward the Sun and midnight away from it, with 06:00 and 18:00 at the respective dawn and dusk flanks. }). They have also been shown to occur preferrentially on the dayside, during storms or storm recovery\cite{anderson_1990,dai_2015,engebretson_1992,kokubun_1989,liu_2009,ukhorskiy_2005}. 

In the inner magnetosphere, the \Alfven frequency --- and thus the frequency of FLRs --- often coincides with integer or half-integer\footnote{See \cref{sec_harmonics}. } multiples of particle drift frequencies\cite{dai_2013}. The resulting wave-particle interactions can give rise to significant energization and radial diffusion of the particles. In some cases, the waves also include an electric field parallel to the background magnetic field, contributing to the precipitation of energetic particles into the neutral atmosphere\cite{goertz_1984,goertz_1979,thompson_1996,wygant_2002}. 

The present chapter introduces the structural characteristics of FLRs, how those characteristics affect wave behavior, and several unresolved questions related to that behavior.

\section{Harmonic Structure}
  \label{sec_harmonics}

Wave structure along a geomagnetic field line is indicated by harmonic number. The first (or fundamental) harmonic has a wavelength twice as long as the field line. It exhibits an antinode in the perpendicular electric field at the equator, along with a node in the perpendicular magnetic field. The second harmonic is a single wavelength along the field line. Its perpendicular magnetic perturbation has an antinode at the equator, while its perpendicular electric field has a node. \cref{fig_harmonics} shows a qualitative sketch of each: a series of snapshots in time, in the rest frame of the wave. Perpendicular electric and magnetic field perturbations are shown in blue and red respectively. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/harmonics.pdf}
    \caption[First and Second Harmonic Resonances]{
      The first (or fundamental) harmonic has an an antinode in its perpendicular electric field (blue) at the equator, along with a node in its perpendicular magnetic field perturbation (red). A single satellite can identify the first harmonic by the relative phase of the electric and magnetic field perturbations: an observer north of the equator (green) will see the electric field perturbation lead the magnetic field by \SI{90}{\degree}. The second harmonic is the opposite: it has an electric field node at the equator, and an observer north of the equator will see the electric field perturbation lag the magnetic field by \SI{90}{\degree}. The purple line sketches the path of a particle in drift-bounce resonance; in the particle's rest frame, the electric field is always to the right. 
    }
    \label{fig_harmonics}
\end{figure}

A first-harmonic FLR that is periodic or localized in the azimuthal direction is conducive to drift-resonant wave-particle interactions\cite{dai_2013,poulter_1983}. The particle is like a child on a swing: whenever the path of the particle (or child) gets close to the wave (parent), it gets a push, and always in the same direction. The wave fields spend half its time pointing the other direction, just as the parent must shift their weight backward to get ready for the next push, but at that point the particle (child) is far away. 

Second-harmonic FLRs interact with particles through the drift-bounce resonance, which is slightly more complicated. As the particle drifts azimuthally, it also zig-zags north-south. The combination of those two periodic motions must align with the phase of the wave electric field. An example path is shown by the purple line in \cref{fig_harmonics}: the particle experiences a rightward electric field throughout the wave's oscillation. 

The drift and drift-bounce resonance conditions is written, respectively\cite{takahashi_2011}:
\begin{align}
  \omega - \azm \omega_D &= 0 &
  &\text{and}&
  \omega - \azm \omega_D &= \omega_B
\end{align}

Where $\omega$ is the frequency of the wave, $\omega_D$ and $\omega_B$ are the particle's drift and bounce frequencies respectively, and \azm is the wave's azimuthal modenumber, as discussed in \cref{sec_azm}. 

In principle, the first and second harmonics can be distinguished by their frequencies, even from a single-point observation\cite{cummings_1969,green_1985}.  In practice, however, this is not a reliable approach\cite{takahashi_2013}. There are significant uncertainties surrounding the number density profile --- and thus the \Alfven speed profile --- along a geomagnetic field line. 

Harmonic structure can also be deduced by noting the phase offset between the wave magnetic field and its electric field (or the plasma velocity)\cite{dai_2015,takahashi_1992}. In \cref{fig_harmonics}, the green line indicates an observer just north of the magnetic equator. For the first harmonic, the observer sees the electric field waveform lead the magnetic field by a phase of \SI{90}{\degree}; for the second harmonic, the electric field waveform lags by \SI{90}{\degree}. (South of the equator, the signs are reversed.) Notably, this approach has only become viable with the advent of satellites carrying both electric and magnetic field instrumentation, such as THEMIS in 2007\cite{angelopoulos_2008} and the Van Allen Probes\footnote{The Van Allen Probes were previously called RBSP, for Radiation Belt Storm Probes. } in 2012\cite{stratton_2012}. 

Strictly speaking, the the phase offset of the electric and magnetic fields does not provide the harmonic number --- only its parity. It's reasonably safe to assume that an even mode is the second harmonic; the second harmonic is by far the most commonly observed\cite{hughes_1978,singer_1982,takahashi_1990}, due in part to its excitement by the antisymmetric balloon instability\cite{chan_1994,chen_1991,cheng_1994,southwood_1976}. However, the distinction between the first and third harmonics is not always clear; this issue is discussed further in \cref{ch_rbsp}. Higher harmonics than that are not expected in the Pc4 frequency band. 

% Of 390 noncompressional events, Dai identified 19 to be clearly fundamental mode and 197 to be clearly second harmonic\cite{dai_2015}. 

\todo{Second-harmonic FLRs are unlikely to cause ground signatures\cite{takahashi_1992}. }

\todo{Dai found a nice event\cite{dai_2013} that was unambiguously determined to be a fundamental-mode Pc4 in drift-resonant interaction with \about\SI{e5}{\eV} ions. Consistent with \cite{thompson_2001}. Other observations of odd harmonics: \cite{yang_2010,eriksson_2005}. }

\section{Azimuthal Modenumber}
  \label{sec_azm}

The wavelength of an FLR in the azimuthal direction is indicated by its azimuthal wavelength. A wave with modenumber \azm has an azimuthal wavelength that spans $\frac{24}{\azm}$ hours in MLT. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/placeholder.jpg}
    \caption[Large and Small Azimuthal Modenumbers]{
      \todo{Large and small azimuthal modenumbers.}
    }
    \label{fig_azm}
\end{figure}

Waves with small azimuthal modenumbers ($0 < \azm < 10$) are typically driven by broadband energy sources at the magnetosphere's boundary, such as variations in the solar wind pressure\cite{degeling_2014,hao_2014,kessel_2008,zong_2007,zong_2009}, sporadic magnetic reconnection\cite{hughes_1994}, or Kelvin-Helmholtz waves on the magnetopause\cite{chen_1974,liu_2011,southwood_1974}. In the low-\azm regime, the shear and compressional \Alfven waves are coupled, which allows energy to move across field lines until the driving frequency lines up with the local \Alfven frequency\cite{lysak_1992}. Because of their broadband energy source, low-\azm FLRs often have a mishmash of frequencies present in their spectra\cite{dai_2015}.

When the azimuthal modenumber is large (or, equally, when the azimuthal wavelength is small), the shear and compressional \Alfven waves are decoupled\cite{cummings_1969,radoski_1974}\footnote{Equally, the strength of a wave's parallel component hint at its modenumber, a point which is revisited in \cref{ch_rbsp}. }. As a result, FLRs must be driven from within the magnetosphere. Proposed energy sources include phase space gradients near the plasmapause\cite{dai_2013}, particularly as the plasmasphere refills after a storm or substorm\cite{engebretson_1992,liu_2013}. 

The ionosphere is known to attenuate waves with small spatial extent in the perpendicular direction\cite{hughes_1976,wright_1999,yeoman_2001}. As a result, FLRs may create no signature on the ground if their azimuthal modenumber is large. For example, a recent paper by Takahashi shows a strong (\SI{2}{\nT} at $L\sim10$), clear resonance with $|\azm|\gtrsim70$ and no corresponding ground signature\cite{takahashi_2013}. 

Southwood\cite{southwood_1976} and Glassmeier\cite{glassmeier_1984} show that a low frequency wave passing through the ionosphere on its way to Earth will be attenuated per
\begin{align}
  \label{attenuation}
  \frac{B_E}{B_I} &= \frac{\Sigma_H}{\Sigma_P} \exp \arg{ -\azm \frac{R_I - R_E}{R_E \sin \theta} }
\end{align}

Where $B_E$ and $B_I$ are the magnetic field strengths at $R_E$ (Earth's surface, \SI{6783}{\km} geocentric) and $R_I$ (the ionosphere, \about\SI{6900}{\km} geocentric) respectively. The integrated ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductivities, $\Sigma_P$ and $\Sigma_H$, are typically within a factor of two of one another. Field lines near the plasmapause can be traced to Earth at $\sin\theta\about0.4$. That is, by the time it reaches the ground, the magnetic field from an FLR with $m=10$ is weaker by a factor of two; at $m=100$, the factor is closer to 100.

\section{Poloidal and Toroidal Polarizations}

%- One sentence paragraphs aren't
%- "Perhaps not coincidentally" Perhaps?
%- Fig. 3.4: I don't know how to read this plot. I guess the left is the first harmonic and the right is the second, but at first glance they looked the same. I guess I get it now...
%- Page 18 (page number not PDF number): You have half a sentence hanging on. You should probably make this images their own page.

Based on polarization, each FLR can be classified as either poloidal or toroidal. The poloidal mode is a field line displacement in the meridional plane, as shown in \cref{fig_poloidal}, with an accompanying electric field in the azimuthal direction. The toroidal mode's magnetic displacement is azimuthal, per \cref{fig_toroidal}; the associated electric field is in the meridional plane. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/poloidal.pdf}
    \caption[Poloidal Mode Structure]{
      The poloidal resonance is a magnetic field in the meridional plane. The displacement is radial near the equator, and can be accompanied by enhancement in the parallel magnetic field near the ionosphere. The first harmonic is shown on the left, and the second harmonic on the right. Lines are colored red and blue only to contrast with the unperturbed black field line. 
    }
    \label{fig_poloidal}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/toroidal.pdf}
    \caption[Toroidal Mode Structure]{
      A toroidally-polarized FLR has a magnetic perturbation in the azimuthal direction, as shown. Bold lines are taken to be above the page, and dotted lines below the page, with the displacement indicated by the line's width. The first harmonic --- where the entire field line oscillates in and out of the page --- is shown on the left. The second harmonic is on the right, with northern and southern halves perturbed in opposite directions. 
    }
    \label{fig_toroidal}
\end{figure}

Both poloidal and toroidal waves are noted for their ability to contribute to the energization and radial diffusion of trapped particles. The poloidal mode interacts more strongly, since its electric field is aligned with the trapped particles' drift motion. Poloidally-polarized waves are also more prone to creating magnetic signatures on the ground, due to ducting in the ionosphere\cite{fujita_1988,greifinger_1968}. 

Toroidal modes have been shown to far outnumber poloidal modes\cite{anderson_1990}. Perhaps not coincidentally, poloidally-polarized waves rotate asymptotically to the toroidal mode\cite{mann_1995,mann_1997,radoski_1974}. Poloidal waves with low azimuthal modenumber --- such as those driven by broadband sources at the magnetopause --- rotate on timescales comparable to their oscillation periods. 

\todo{Fishbone instability\cite{chen_1984,mcguire_1983}. Like the poloidal mode, but for lab plasmas. }

\todo{Poloidal and toroidal modes are coupled by the ionospheric Hall conductivity\cite{kato_1956}. The Hall conductivity also increases the ``ringtime'' of these resonances, allowing them to oscillate through the inductive process rather than be dissipated as Joule heating\cite{waters_2013}. }

\todo{Toroidal modes show a clear frequency dependence with $L$. Poloidal modes less so. Citation...? }

\section{Giant Pulsations}

%- What's special about Tromso Norway? I feel like you need half a sentence more!

The study of geomagnetic pulsations long predates satellites, sounding rockets, or even the word ``magnetohydrodynamics''\footnote{The term was first used by \Alfven in the 1940s\cite{alfven_1946}. }. Large, regular oscillations in the magnetic field were noted as early as 1901\cite{birkeland_1901}. Eventually, the term ``giant pulsation,'' or Pg, arose to describe such pulsations. 

On the ground, Pgs are notable for their strikingly sinusoidal waveforms, their eastward drifts, and their specific occurrence pattern: Pgs are typically seen pre-dawn, at latitudes of \SIrange{60}{70}{\degree}. Pgs generally fall into the Pc4 frequency band\footnote{The Pc4 range is periods of \SIrange{45}{140}{\s}, while Pgs are often said to range from \SIrange{60}{200}{\s}\cite{brekke_1987}. }. Their harmonic structure was a source of controversy for decades, but recent multisatellite observations seem to be in agreement that they are odd harmonics, probably fundamental\cite{glassmeier_1999,hillebrand_1982,kokubun_1980,kokubun_1989,takahashi_2011,takahashi_1992}. They are poloidally polarized, with modenumbers $10 \lesssim \azm \lesssim 40$\cite{glassmeier_1980,hillebrand_1982,poulter_1983,rostoker_1979,takahashi_1992}. 

Whereas FLRs are waves in space which may produce ground signatures, ``giant pulsation'' refers to the ground signature specifically\footnote{Historically, the wave designations shown in \cref{tab_iaga} 
all referred to ground phenomena. Over time, they have come to describe satellite observations as well, including those without corresponding signatures on the ground. }. That is, Takahashi's satellite observation of a sinusoidal, morningside, high-\azm, fundamental poloidal resonance was not classified as a Pg because it did not produce a signal on the ground\cite{takahashi_2013}. 

%  --- half of them measured at Troms{\o}, Norway

Due to their remarkably clear waveforms, Pgs are typically found by ``visual inspection of magnetometer data''\cite{motoba_2015}. Over the course of the past century, a number of multi-year (sometimes multi-decade\cite{brekke_1987}) surveys have totaled nearly one thousand Pg events. On average, a ground magnetometer near \SI{66}{\degree} magnetic latitude observes \about10 Pg events per year\cite{brekke_1987,harang_1941,rolf_1931,sucksdorff_1939}. Observations are not distributed uniformly; rather, giant pulsations become more common near the equinox and during times of low solar activity. 

Unlike Pc4 pulsations in general, Pgs show no particular correlation with storm phase\cite{motoba_2015}. However, they do often occur as the magnetosphere recovers from a substorm\cite{motoba_2015,rostoker_1979}.

\section{Motivations for the Present Work}

A great deal has been learned --- and continues to be learned --- through observations of field line resonance. However, the cost-to-benefit ratio is climbing. As summarized in the sections above, FLR behavior depends significantly on harmonic structure, azimuthal modenumber, and polarization --- not to mention frequency, spectral width, and so on. With each degree of freedom comes the necessity for an additional simultaneous observation. 

Similarly, as FLRs have been shown to depend on ever-more-specific magnetospheric conditions, analytical techniques have fallen out of favor. The height-resolved ionosphere, the multidimensional \Alfven speed profile, and the inconvenient geometry combine to create a problem beyond the reasonable purview of pencil and paper. 

That is, the topic of field line resonance is ripe for numerical modeling. 

Past models of the magnetosphere have been ill-suited for the consideration of FLRs. Reasons include overly-simplified treatment of the ionospheric boundary, no consideration of the plasmapause, limited range in \azm, and the inability to compute ground signatures. \cref{ch_model} presents a model which addresses these issues, allowing the computation of field line resonance with unparalleled attention to realism. 

The model allows a bird's-eye view of the structure and evolution of FLRs. As such, not only can several open questions be addressed, but their answers serve to unify a number of seemingly-disparate properties described in the sections above. 

The rotation of poloidally-polarized waves to the toroidal mode is investigated. Particular attention is paid to the importance of azimuthal modenumber and ionospheric conductivity. The interplay between said rotation and the transport of energy across field lines --- which also depends on azimuthal modenumber --- is considered as well. 

By their nature, drifting particles have the potential to spur wave-particle interactions at all MLT. However, Pc4 observations are strongly peaked on the dayside. In a 2015 paper, Dai notes, ``It is not clear why noncompressional [high-\azm] Pc4 poloidal waves, which are presumably driven by instability within the magnetosphere, preferrentially occur on the dayside''\cite{dai_2015}. Motoba, later that year, echoes, ``It is unclear whether other generation mechanisms of fundamental standing waves ... can explain the localization of Pgs in local time''\cite{motoba_2015}. This, too, is considered numerically: to what degree is field line resonance affected by the (day-night asymmetric) conditions of the ionosphere? 

\todo{Transition... With the above in mind, what data would be super helpful? }

It's been shown that a ground magnetometer \SI{66}{\degree} north of the magnetic equator observes \about10 Pg events per year. It's also been shown that poloidal Pc4s are rare compared to toroidal ones, and that most poloidal Pc4s are even harmonics. However, little attention has been paid to how these rates line up with one another. Given the relative occurrence rate of poloidal and toroidal waves, of odd and even harmonics, and of diffuse and sharp spectral peaks, just how unusual are giant pulsations? 


%The present work uses a numerical model to investigate the preferrential occurrence of field line resonances in the Pc4 range --- particularly first-harmonic poloidal modes, such as giant pulsations --- in MLT. 

%Giant pulsations are commonly referred to as ``rare''\cite{brekke_1987}, or even ``a small subset of fundamental poloidal waves''\cite{takahashi_2013}. However, quantification of Pg occurrence --- compared to the occurrence rate of fundamental poloidal Pc4s in general --- is thin on the ground. It's been shown that poloidal Pc4s are rare compared to their toroidal counterparts. It's also been shown that, among poloidal Pc4s, the second harmonic is the most common. 


% Dai writes, in his 2015 paper\cite{dai_2015}, ``It is not clear why noncompressional [high-\azm] Pc4 poloidal waves, which are presumably driven by instability within the magnetosphere, preferrentially occur on the dayside.'' 

% Motoba\cite{motoba_2015}, similarly, notes ``It is unclear whether other generation mechanisms of fundamental standing waves ... can explain the localization of Pgs in local time.''


% Giant pulsations have variously been referred to as ``intriguing''\cite{green_1985}. ``rare''\cite{brekke_1987}, even to the point of being ``a small subset of fundamental poloidal waves''\cite{takahashi_2013} --- note that it's well known that fundamental poloidal mode waves are already rare in comparison to second harmonic waves. 


%\todo{What's going on with the MLT localization of Pc4 pulsations? Is there something spooky going on with the driving? Maybe the ionosphere just kills FLRs on the nightside! }

%\todo{What's so special about Pgs? How rare are they, really, compared to fundamental poloidal modes in general? How does that line up with the occurrence rate of nice, sinusoidal waveforms in second-harmonic Pc4s? That is, is there something special about Pgs, or do they just live in a ``sweet spot'' with respect to constraints on observation and resonance? }

%\todo{Parallel electric fields. In this regime, we're looking at inertial effects, not kinetic effects\cite{goertz_1979,thompson_1996}. Should produce non-monoenergetic precipitation, which are observed\cite{goertz_1984}. Consistent with MHD models\cite{chaston_2000,chaston_2002}. Inertial-scale structures observed with Polar\cite{wygant_2002}. }

%\todo{The plasmapause matters! Effective potential well, analogous to \Schrodinger's equation\cite{lee_1998,lee_1999,dai_2009}. Shown in theory\cite{klimushkin_1998,leonovich_2000,klimushkin_2004,mager_2013} and in observation\cite{takahashi_2009,takahashi_2010}.  }

%\todo{All sorts of FLR occur preferrentially (though not exclusively) on the dayside\cite{dai_2015,ukhorskiy_2005}. }

%\todo{Any waves with frequencies of $\SIrange{e-3}{1}{\Hz}$ are termed ULF waves --- ultra low frequency. ULF waves are furthermore categorized in terms of their morphological characteristics. Pc waves are continuous (exhibiting a fairly consistent waveform over a large number of wave periods) while Pi are irregular; the waves are further partitioned into frequency bands. See \cref{tab_iaga}. }

%\todo{These are Jacobs' original ranges... but are they really reflective of the jargon still used? It's weird that these ranges bottom out so far below 1000s. }

%\todo{While the IAGA characterizations are based on wave morphology, they do a decent job of deliniating between the different underlying physical processes as well. Pi2 pulsations (irregular waves with periods of a minute or two) tend to be excited on the nightside; they are associated with substorm onset (though the processes that give rise to Pi2s --- and their relation to substorm onset --- remains controversial). Pc1 and Pc2 pulsations tend to be EMIC (electromagnetic ion cyclotron) waves near the ion gyrofrequency, which are important for the precipitation of electrons (?). }

%Pi2: ``Clearly linked to substorm disturbances and other impulsive dynamics are the irregularly shaped waves in the 7--25-mHz band referred to as Pi2. Recent work on these waves suggests that their periodicity reflects the spectrum of global mode excitations of the plasmasphere but there is a competing proposal that the dominant frequencies are imposed by the modulated flows in the magnetotail.''\cite{kivelson_2006}

%\todo{The present work is specifically concerned with field line resonances near the plasmapause. These waves fall in the Pc4 range, with frequencies around \SI{10}{\mHz}\footnote{Notably, field line resonances can also fall within the Pc3 and Pc5 ranges. }. }

% Less than a decade later, Sigura presented observational evidence of the phenomenon: a wave seen simultaneously at the northern and southern foot points of a geomagnetic field line\cite{sigura_1961}. 

%\todo{There's no discussion of ULF frequency bands, or even use the term ``Pc4.'' That's probably a problem. Introduce \SIrange{7}{25}{\mHz}! }

% \todo{Pc4s are localized in L and in MLT\cite{anderson_1990,dai_2015,engebretson_1992,liu_2009}. Near the plasmapause. This is an important part of why the 2.5D model is a good fit! }

% \todo{Drift resonance with azimuthal wavenumber. In the analogy of a parent pushing a child on the swing, the child still gains energy even if the parent only shows up half the time. Or Are there a bunch of parents? The analogy starts to fall apart past there. }

%``To summarize, the general buffetting of the magnetosphere by variations in the solar wind dynamic pressure, or perhaps by sporadic magnetic reconnection, provides a broad band energy source to the magnetosphere. The magnetospheric cavity as a whole rings at its own eigenfrequencies, thus transporting energy at just those frequencies to field lines deep in the magnetosphere. Those field lines whose eigenfrequencies match one of the cavity eigenfrequencies couple to the cavity mode and resonate strongly, producing the classical field line resonance signature.\cite{hughes_1994}'' 

% Compressional driving doesn't preclude drift or drift-bounce resonance\cite{zong_2007,zong_2009}. 

% The strength of the compressional-poloidal coupling indicates \azm\cite{hughes_1994}. 

% Low-\azm waves tend to be more muddled... driven by broadband sources rather than resonance\cite{dai_2015}. 

% Small structures are also damped; resonances narrower than $\sim \SI{100}{km}$ aren't visible on the ground. See also Glassmeier and Stellmacher, 2000 (about small latitude). \Alfven waves with small latitudinal scale\cite{glassmeier_2000} are screened by the ionosphere. Attenuation factor from \cite{hughes_1976} and \cite{glassmeier_1984}. 

%``Pgs maybe a manifestation of a small subset of fundamental poloidal waves excited in the magnetopause.'' \cite{takahashi_2013}

%``It is not clear why noncompressional [high-\azm] Pc4 poloidal waves, which are presumably driven by instability within the magnetosphere, preferrentially occur on the dayside.\cite{dai_2015}''

%``It is unclear whether other generation mechanisms of fundamental standing waves such as drift wave instability\cite{green_1979} can explain the localization of Pgs in local time (LT).''\cite{motoba_2015}

% Shear mode incident on the ionosphere, pederson current closes FAC, Hall current then generates a fast mode wave which may be detected in space or on the ground\cite{tamao_1965}. 

% Poloidal and toroidal ULF polarizations are treated differently by the ionosphere\cite{greifinger_1968} (more recently, \cite{fujita_1988}) due to ducting by the ionosphere. 

% In the example shown of a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4, and in the example of a higher harmonic Pc4, a mishmash of toroidal activity is present. \cite{dai_2015}, figure 8 and 9 respectively. 

% Observations of odd-mode poloidal waves... possible fundamental\cite{yang_2010,eriksson_2005}.

% \todo{Do the unambiguous Pc4 events in \cite{takahashi_2011} and \cite{dai_2013} also have a mishmash of toroidal activity? NO. }

% Poloidal Pc4s occur primarily during geomagnetically active times\cite{dai_2015}. This confirmed and refined older work\cite{engebretson_1987}. 

% Drift resonance happens when the bounce frequency of an \Alfven wave between the northern and southern ionospheres matches the bounce frequency of nearby particles. It allows the energization of ring current and radiation belt particles through drift and drift-bounce resonance\cite{elkington_1999,mann_2013,ozeke_2008,southwood_1976}. By multiple wave-particle interactions, poloidal ULF waves [FLRs] can lead to radial diffusion of radiation belt particles\cite{elkington_2003,ozeke_2012,tu_2012}.

% ULF waves have been shown to correlate with pulsating aurora and with chorus\cite{jaynes_2015}. It's believed that (in the case presented) substorm injection drove Pc4-5 pulsations, which modulated chorus waves, which pitch-angle scattered electrons with energies on the order of \SI{10}{\kilo\eV}. 

% \todo{Theoretical consideration of decay vs propagation, by frequency. Lysak and Yoshikawa 2006. }

% Drift-wave instability\cite{hasegawa_1971,green_1979,green_1985} is also a possibility for exciting fundamental poloidal waves, though it requires cold plasma, so it could only happen in the plasmasphere. 

% AMPTE/CCE data has shown a correlation between poloidal Pc4 activity and intense ring current flux near the equator\cite{engebretson_1988}. 

% Toroidal mode is usually associated with external driving\cite{chen_1974,southwood_1974}. 

% A Hall-conducting ionosphere reflects ULF waves\cite{hughes_1974}. 

% Compressional poloidal Pc4 pulsations are much more common during storms, but not particularly sensitive to storm phase. Noncompressional ones occur primarily during recovery\cite{dai_2015,rostoker_1979,engebretson_1992,anderson_1994}. Note that Dai\cite{dai_2015} was pretty generous about what counted as a storm... anything that hits \SI{-30}{\nano\tesla}. So \cite{motoba_2015} may not have counted the same way when they found no particular correlation with storm phase. 

%\todo{First Pg observation\cite{birkeland_1901}. }

%\todo{Strong poloidal (that is, meridional) polarization in space, combined with the \about\SI{90}{\degree} rotation of long-period waves by the ionosphere\cite{nishida_1964_screening,hughes_1974}, gives Pgs a distinctive east-west polarization on the ground. }

%\todo{Pgs are most common during solar minimum, perhaps because of decreased mass loading of heavy ions\cite{denton_2011}. }

%\todo{The harmonic structure of giant pulsations was once controversial; at this point, there is general consensus (based on satellite data) that they are fundamental poloidal modes\cite{glassmeier_1999,hillebrand_1982,kokubun_1980,kokubun_1989,takahashi_1992,takahashi_2011}. }

%\todo{Giant pulsations observed on the ground tend to have azimuthal modenumbers $10 \lesssim \azm \lesssim 40$\cite{glassmeier_1980,hillebrand_1982,poulter_1983,rostoker_1979,takahashi_1992}. }

%\todo{Giant pulsations peak around \SI{66}{\degree} MLAT\cite{motoba_2015}, corresponding to L=6, but have been observed at $5 \lesssim L \lesssim 7$\cite{green_1985}. Most prevalent on the morningside, with some in the afternoon. }

% Another past study: \cite{takahashi_1984_spectrum}. Satellite data is surveyed and classified by polarization, harmonic, wavenumber, etc, in order to determine the mechanisms for generating \Alfven waves. Old, but still pretty representative, according to Motoba\cite{motoba_2015}. 

% A long-period \Alfven wave passing through the ionosphere is rotated by about 90 degrees\cite{nishida_1964_screening,hughes_1974}. That would translate a poloidal resonance in space to an east-west ground signature. 

% \cite{motoba_2015} suggests that Pgs originate from the fundamental poloidal mode waves at all local times. 

% It seems to be the convention to find a Pg event on the ground, then look at satellite data. That's certainly what was done in \cite{motoba_2015}. 

% Per \cite{motoba_2015}, most Pg events happen around $L=7$, but some do happen near the plasmapause, as seen(?) by \cite{green_1985}. 

% ``The AL distribution shown in Figure 14c are consistent with the findings of \cite{rostoker_1979} that Pgs occur as the magnetosphere recovers from previous activities (substorms).''\cite{motoba_2015} Finds this to be reasonable because it's ``very likely'' that energetic ions injected into the inner magnetosphere from the magnetotail provide energy to Pgs. 

% Analysis of GOES data from 2008 to 2013 shows about 100 Pg events. They are concentrated on the morningside. No particular correlation with storm phase\cite{motoba_2015}. 

% Recall compressional poloidal Pc4s are mostly during storm time, and noncompressional are mostly specifically during late recovery\cite{dai_2015}. Only 19 fundamental poloidal mode examples were identified from the 390 noncompressional poloidal events.
