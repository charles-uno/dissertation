\chapter{Electron Inertial Effects}
\label{ch_inertia}

\todo{Note that Bob's 2011 paper\cite{lysak_2011} had inertial effects. }

The model described in \cref{ch_model} has the notable omission of parallel electric fields and parallel currents. That situation can be remedied by the addition of the electron inertial term in \ohmlaw. 

Old parallel electric field formulation. Recall $\vec{F} \equiv \curl{B}$. 
\begin{align}
  \ez \ddt E_\parallel &= \frac{1}{\mu_0} F_\parallel - \sz E_\parallel
\end{align}

New parallel electric field formulation. The parallel current must now be tracked explicitly. 
\begin{align}
  \label{def_inertia}
  \ez \ddt E_\parallel &= \frac{1}{\mu_0} F_\parallel - J_\parallel &
  \ddt J_\parallel &= \frac{n e^2}{m} E_\parallel - \nu J_\parallel
\end{align}

In the new formulation, $J_\parallel$ (equally, $J_3$) is solved with integrating factors and $E_\parallel$ ($E_3$) can be advanced directly. 
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  E_3 &\assign E_3 + c^2 \dt \, \lr{ g_{31} F^1 + g_{33} F^3 } - \frac{\dt}{\ez} J_3 \\
  J_3 &\assign J_3 \exp \arg{ - \nu \dt } + \frac{n e^2}{m} \dt \, E_3 \exp \arg{ -\nu \tfrac{\dt}{2} }
  \end{split}
\end{align}

Recall that the electric and magnetic fields are staggered by half a time step. The current is defined with the magnetic fields, offset from the electric fields.

\section{The Boris Approximation}

Note that 
\begin{align}
  \ddt E_\parallel &\sim -\frac{1}{\ez} J_\parallel &
  & \text{and} & 
  \ddt J_\parallel &\sim \frac{n e^2}{\me} E_\parallel &
  & \text{so} &
  \frac{ \partial^2 }{ \partial t^2 } E_\parallel &\sim -\op^2 E_\parallel
\end{align}

That is, the addition of the electron inertial term in \ohmlaw allows plasma oscillations. 

As noted in \cref{sec_e}, the plasma frequency is very large. Much larger than $\frac{1}{\dt}$. But $\op \dt < 1$ is necessary for stability. In order to accommodate that condition, the time step in some runs would need to be dropped by three orders of magnitude; a simulation slated for one hour would suddenly take six weeks to complete. 

The time step dictated by the \Alfven speed and grid spacing is typically on the order of $\SI{10}{\us}$, while the plasma frequency can be as small as $\SI{10}{\ns}$. 

The plasma frequency (and the speed of light) can be decreased by taking an artificially large value for \ez. Such approximations have been staples of numerical MHD models since Boris' work in 1970\cite{boris_1970}.

Lysak and Song\cite{lysak_2001} demonstrate the validity of such an approximation. To paraphrase their work, take \cref{def_inertia} and suppose that $E_\parallel$ and $J_\parallel$ are oscillating at a frequency $\omega$. Then,
\begin{align}
  - i \omega \ez E_\parallel &= \oomz F_\parallel - J_\parallel & - i \omega J_\parallel &= \frac{n e^2}{\me} E_\parallel - \nu J_\parallel
\end{align}

So
\begin{align}
  \label{boris_criterion}
  \lr{ 1 - \frac{\omega^2 - i \nu \omega}{\op^2} } E_\parallel &= \frac{c^2}{\op^2} \lr{ \nu - i \omega } F_\parallel
\end{align}

Here $\frac{c}{\op}$ is the electron inertial length. While the speed of light and the plasma frequency each depend on \ez, their ratio does not. So long as $\lr{ 1 - \frac{\omega^2 - i \nu \omega}{\op^2} } \sim 1$, a change in \ez should not affect model behavior. 

For the purposes of simulating ultra low frequency waves, \cref{boris_criterion} allows perhaps-implausibly large Boris factors; even increasing \ez by a factor of \num{e6} gives $\left| \frac{\omega^2 + i \omega \nu}{ \op^2 } \right| \lesssim 0.01$. At that point, in some places, the speed of light is significantly slower than the \Alfven speed. 

\todo{Ronnmark\cite{ronnmark_2000} calls this ``anisotropic vacuum.'' }

\todo{Plot of these frequency ratios in the ionosphere? }

\todo{Generalized \ohmlaw, in case we decide we need it. Could talk through why all of the other terms are OK to neglect.  
\begin{align}
  \vec{E} + \cross{U}{B} & = 
  \eta \vec{J} + \tfrac{\me}{n e^2} \lrb{
    \tfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \vec{J} + \nabla \cdot \lr{ 
      \vec{J} \, \vec{U} + \vec{U} \,\vec{J} +
      \tfrac{1}{n e} \vec{J} \, \vec{J} } } +
  \tfrac{1}{n e} \cross{J}{B} -
  \tfrac{1}{n e} \div{ \vec{P_e} }
\end{align}
}

\section{Field-Aligned Current}
  \label{sec_fac}

Parallel electric fields and field-aligned currents are overwhelmingly imaginary, indicating an azimuthal offset compared to the driving. This is in line with \farlaw. The toroidal magnetic field $B_y$ is imaginary, so $\partial_x B_y$ is also imaginary. The poloidal magnetic field $B_x$ is real, but azimuthal derivatives are taken with a factor of $i \azm$, so $\partial_y B_x$ is imaginary.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/JS_1_016mHz.pdf}
    \caption[Field-Aligned Current and Poynting Flux at $R_I$: Active Day, \SI{16}{mHz} Current]{
      While the (complex) phase of the field-aligned current is aligned with that of the toroidal mode, its magnitude shows no such preference. When a toroidal wave carries Poynting flux to the ionosphere, field-aligned currents are created. When the Poynting flux is carried by a poloidal mode, currents are also created. The field-aligned current signature at the ionospheric boundary matches closely to the sum of the poloidal and toroidal Poynting flux signatures. 
    }

\end{figure}

\todo{Notably, while the net Poynting flux is downward almost everywhere, field-aligned currents alternate between upward and downward flow. Perhaps this has to do with Poynting flux being a quadratic quantity while current is linear? Check the phases of the electric and magnetic fields. }

      While field-aligned currents can be of significant size, they are not particularly good at depositing energy in the ionosphere. Energy deposited by the Poynting flux matches closely with Joule dissipation from the perpendicular currents -- energy conservation! -- while $J_\parallel E_\parallel$ is smaller by several orders of magnitude.

\section{Inertial Length Scales}

A typical run has maximum $E_y$ on the order of \SI{10}{\mV/\meter\squared} and maximum $E_z$ on the order of \SI{e-3}{\mV/\meter\squared}. The two components could still have similar effects depending on their spatial scales. 

At the ionospheric boundary, signatures in $E_y$ can vary on length scales of about \SI{1}{\degree}. This gives $\dd{x} E_y \dt \sim \SI{e-3}{nT/\second}$. 

The usual grid can't resolve features much smaller than that. This means that the model isn't capturing any features on the electron inertial length scale, $\frac{c}{\op}$, which bottoms out around $\SI{e-1}{\km}$ inside the plasmasphere, and $\SI{1}{\km}$ outside it. 

The very small $E_z$ values being seen are unlikely to dominate $E_x$, but if inertial length scales were resolved in the perpendicular direction then $\dd{x} E_z \dt$ could be as large as \SI{e-4}{nT/\second}. 

Resolving electron inertial lengths is computationally very expensive. 

The range of $L$ values is decreased from \SIrange{2}{10}{\RE} to \SIrange{5}{7}{\RE}. The number of grid points in the perpendicular direction is increased by a factor of five. This drops the time step by an order of magnitude -- smaller zones have smaller crossing times! 

All in all, a run that resolves inertial length scales is a factor of 100 more expensive than one that doesn't. 

\todo{Several such runs are going right now. They should finish over the weekend. Then we can see what our tiny grid spacing buys us! }
