\chapter{From the Sun to the Earth}
\label{ch_intro}

It's all about energy transfer! 

Some example citations, including a few with special characters: \cite{dai_2013}, \cite{dai_2015}, \cite{lysak_2001}. 

%There are a lot of interrelated things going on, so it's hard to describe Earth's environment one step at a time. Look at Scott's thesis -- he did this well, right? 

%Heliosphere, Magnetosphere, Ionosphere, Atmosphere?

%Current systems, convective systems, density profiles?

Talking about the solar wind... maybe even a big about the solar dynamo.

Table: bounce times as a function of L. How much does this depend on day vs night, storm vs calm?
