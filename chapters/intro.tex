\chapter{The Near-Earth Environment}
\label{ch_intro}

\todo{So far, this chapter is just a tentative outline. }

%There are a lot of interrelated things going on, so it's hard to describe Earth's environment one step at a time. Look at Scott's thesis -- he did this well, right? 

%Heliosphere, Magnetosphere, Ionosphere, Atmosphere?

%Current systems, convective systems, density profiles?

It's all about energy transfer! Sun generates energy through nuclear reactions. Some of this energy is transported in the solar wind, which drives behavior in the near-Earth environment. 

%Typical solar wind density is $\sim$ \SI{5}{/\cm\cubed}. Typical solar wind velocity at Earth is \SIrange{e2}{e3}{\km/\s}. Typical solar wind particle energy is \SIrange{1}{10}{\kilo\eV}. Density can vary by $\sim$3 orders of magnitude, and velocity by one, during times of high solar activity. CMEs can also mess with the north/south component of the interplanetary magnetic field. 

At Earth's orbit, the solar magnetic field makes more-or-less a \SI{45}{\degree} angle with the \X axis. 
\footnote{Uppercase \X, \Y, and \Z are used to indicate GSE coordinates: \X points from the Earth to the Sun; \Y is perpendicular to \X in the Sun's ecliptic plane, pointing duskwards; \Z points north, out of the ecliptic plane. In later chapters, lowercase \x, \y, and \z are used to define a more-or-less analogous corodinate system with respect to Earth. }

% Solar wind is what deforms Earth's magnetic field to form the magnetosphere. 

% Transient solar wind phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections, are also known to be related to geomagnetic disturbances at Earth. Jesse cites here:

\section{The Outer Magnetosphere}

The outer magnetosphere is a region where the field lines are closed, but significantly deformed by the solar wind. 

\subsection{The Magnetopause}

\subsection{The Magnetotail}

\subsection{Cusp Regions}

\todo{The cusp regions might not even need to be mentioned... they're not specifically important here. }

\section{The Inner Magnetosphere}

In the inner magnetosphere, field lines are closed, and are approximately dipolar. 

\subsection{The Plasmasphere}

\section{The Ionosphere}

The ionosphere is immediately above Earth's neutral atmosphere. 

%\todo{At present, ionospheric conductivity profiles and the \Alfven speed aren't really illustrated until \cref{sec_ionos}. That's pretty awkward, since \cref{ch_math} makes extensive use of those quantities in a bunch of dispersion relations. They should be introduced before they're used! }
