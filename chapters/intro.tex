\chapter{The Near-Earth Environment}
  \label{ch_intro}

\todo{Sketch out the goneral structure of the magnetosphere, from the ionospheric current sheet (is this too generous?) to the magnetopause (a real current sheet). Talk about where gravity dominates, where field line curvature becomes apparent, and where the moon sits in all this. }

One hundred kilometers above Earth's surface, more or less, the neutral atmosphere transitions sharply into the conducting ionosphere.

3000

10,000 (2RE geocentric)

30,000 (5 RE)

Moon is at 60 RE or so. 

Tail goes back to about 100 RE. 

Ionosphere is dense enough to be shaped by gravity, but as altitude increases, magnetic field dominates.

The nitrogen density (w at sea level) drops from x at 100km to y at 1000km to z at 10**4 km.

By 10**4 km, the curvature of Earth's dipole magnetic field becomes apparent... and, between the increasing ion abundance and the decreasing strength of gravity, it dominates particle behavior.

At 10**5 km, the bow shock. On the dayside, at least. Balance between Earth's magnetic field and that of the sun. Another current sheet... This one far more intense.

Still less than halfway to the moon. That's 3e5 km.

This all takes place well within the orbit of the moon. Moon is about 60 RE away

Where are satellites? Geosynthronous? 

This with is concerned with the behavior of electromagnetic waves that propagate inside the magnetosheath, but outside the ionosphere; in fact, they play a significant role in the transport of energy from the former to the latter. 

Free electron density...

Still mostly neutrals, but collisions are so rare that they don't matter. At x, the mean free path of a neutral atom is comparable to... 

%There are a lot of interrelated things going on, so it's hard to describe Earth's environment one step at a time. Look at Scott's thesis -- he did this well, right? 

%Heliosphere, Magnetosphere, Ionosphere, Atmosphere?

%Current systems, convective systems, density profiles?

It's all about energy transfer! Sun generates energy through nuclear reactions. Some of this energy is transported in the solar wind, which drives behavior in the near-Earth environment. 

%Typical solar wind density is $\sim$ \SI{5}{/\cm\cubed}. Typical solar wind velocity at Earth is \SIrange{e2}{e3}{\km/\s}. Typical solar wind particle energy is \SIrange{1}{10}{\kilo\eV}. Density can vary by $\sim$3 orders of magnitude, and velocity by one, during times of high solar activity. CMEs can also mess with the north/south component of the interplanetary magnetic field. 

At Earth's orbit, the solar magnetic field makes more-or-less a \SI{45}{\degree} angle with the \X axis. 
\footnote{Uppercase \X, \Y, and \Z are used to indicate GSE coordinates: \X points from the Earth to the Sun; \Y is perpendicular to \X in the Sun's ecliptic plane, pointing duskwards; \Z points north, out of the ecliptic plane. In later chapters, lowercase \x, \y, and \z are used to define a more-or-less analogous corodinate system with respect to Earth. }

% Solar wind is what deforms Earth's magnetic field to form the magnetosphere. 

% Transient solar wind phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections, are also known to be related to geomagnetic disturbances at Earth. Jesse cites here:

\section{The Ionosphere}
  \label{sec_ionos}

Pedersen, Hall, and field-aligned conductivity. Do we want to get into two-cell convection? Region 1 and 2 current? 

\todo{Convection electric field. How close to Earth does it get? Don't we lose $\vec{E}=\cross{V}{B}$ when there are currents? }

``Increasing the Hall conductance allows the energy to oscillate through the inductive process rather than dissipate as Joule heating, increasing the `ringtime' of field line resonances.''\cite{waters_2013}

Scale heights. Ion/neutral composition. 

E, F layers. 

Ionospheric \Alfven resonator. This is important if we want to talk briefly about all kinds of ULF waves. 

Precipitation. Inverted V. 

\todo{Scott's thesis has a TON of detail. How much does Jesse show? }

Closed field lines. More or less dipolar. 

The plasmasphere and plasmapause. 

Radiation belts. Radial diffusion is interesting because... 

\Alfven speed. So we probably want to at least mention field line resonance here? Or do we get into that in the next chapter? Plot of \Alfven speeds and \Alfven bounce times for each profile.

Tail and tail lobes. 

Reconnection.

\section{Geomagnetic Disturbances}

Storms! CMEs, etc. 

What causes a storm. 

Storm effects: outer magnetosphere, inner magnetosphere, on the ground.






The ionospheric profiles used in this model are based on values tabulated in the Appendix B of Kelley's book\cite{kelley_1989}. They were adapted by Lysak\cite{lysak_2013} to take into account the effect of the magnetosphere's latitude-dependent density profile. 

Mean molecular mass of \SI{28}{\amu} at \SI{100}{\km}, \SI{16}{\amu} around \SI{400}{\km}, down to \SI{1}{\amu} above \SI{1400}{\km}. 

Simulations are carried out using four profiles: active day, quiet day, active night, quiet night. 

Profiles are static for the duration of a simulation. Even so-called ultra low frequency waves are still much faster than convective timescales. 

\todo{Come up with a characteristic convective timescale or two, and cite it. }

The effects of mean molecular mass on conductivity are computed per the usual definitions. 
\begin{align}
  \sp &= \displaystyle\sum_s \frac{n_s q_s^2}{m_s} \frac{\nu_s}{\nu_s^2 + \Omega_s^2} &
  \sh &= -\displaystyle\sum_s \frac{n_s q_s^2}{m_s} \frac{\Omega_s}{\nu_s^2 + \Omega_s^2} &
  \sz &= \displaystyle\sum_s \frac{n_s q_s^2}{m_s \nu_s}
\end{align}

Each profile is resolved to an altitude of about $\SI{e4}{\km}$, and include well-resolved $E$, $F_1$, and $F_2$ layers.
