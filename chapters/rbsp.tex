\chapter{Comparison to Van Allen Probes}
\label{ch_rbsp}

\todo{After several meetings with Wygant, it looks like the best option for comparisons between simulations and RBSP would be to get a hold of the Pc4 events that Lei used to write his paper last year. In particular, John is interested in seeing some investigation of the 26-day cycle in plasmapause radius. If the size of the plasmasphere matches up to some characteristic -- phase offset, frequency shift, disparity between electric and magnetic field strength, whatever -- then it would be interesting to see if the same correlation appears when the simulation's plasmasphere size is adjusted. }

\todo{This hasn't happened yet. }
