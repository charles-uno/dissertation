  \label{ch_rbsp}

The results presented in \cref{ch_results} are interesting on their own, but become particularly valuable when combined with observational data. Unfortunately, only a small number of studies to date have explored how Pc4 observation rate is affected by the harmonic and polarization structure of those waves. 

While Pc4 pulsations have previously been studied in terms of both harmonic\cite{arthur_1981,cummings_1969,engebretson_1988,hughes_1978,singer_1982,takahashi_1984} and polarization\cite{anderson_1990,dai_2015,dai_2013,kokubun_1989,liu_2009}, little work has considered both at the same time. This has largely been due to observational constraints. The classification of a wave's harmonic is best carried out by computing the phase offset of the magnetic and electric field waveforms, simultaneous in situ measurements of which have only recently become available as part of the THEMIS\cite{angelopoulos_2008} and Van Allen Probe\cite{stratton_2012} missions. The Van Allen Probes (launched in 2012) are particularly well-suited to the study of Pc4 pulsations as their apogee of $L \sim 6$ coincides closely with eigenfrequencies in the Pc4 range. 

The present chapter uses data from the Van Allen Probes' EFW instrument\cite{wygant_2013} to survey the occurrence rate of FLRs in the Pc4 range as a function of harmonic parity and polarization, as well as magnitude, frequency, and phase. The tools used to perform the present analysis --- SPEDAS and the SPICE kernel --- are publicly available. They, along with the Python routines used to download, filter, and plot the data, can be found in a Git repository at \url{https://github.com/chizarlicious/RBSP}. 

\todo{Set this up, along with Tuna, at \url{https://github.com/chizarlicious/UMN_Space-Physics}. }

%Observations show that the poloidal mode is most excited in the second harmonic\cite{cummings_1969,hughes_1978,arthur_1981,singer_1982,takahashi_1984,engebretson_1988} even when there is a strong compressional component\cite{takahashi_1987,haerendel_1999,vaivads_2001,sibeck_2012}. 

%\todo{The tools used in the present chapter --- SPEDAS and the SPICE kernel --- are publicly available. They run best with an IDL license, which is not, but they are functional using just the (free) IDL virtual machine. The code is wrapped up in a Git repository: \url{https://github.com/chizarlicious/RBSP} (maybe should make a GitHub organization to hold this code, to decouple it from my personal account?). }

\section{Sampling Bias and Event Selection}
  \label{sec_selection}

The present analysis makes use of Van Allen Probe data from October 2012 to August 2015 --- the entire range available at the time of writing. Between the two probes, that's just over 2000 days of observation. 

For the purposes of Pc4 pulsations, it's reasonable to consider the two probes to be independent observers. Nearly all Pc4 events occur near apogee ($L\gtrsim5$), at which point the two probes are several hours apart in MLT. Pc4 events are typically not large enough to be seen by both probes simultaneously, and not long enough in duration to be seen by two probes passing through the same region of space several hours apart. 

\todo{Quantify how often an event is seen by both probes? }

Electric and magnetic field waveforms are collected using the probes' EFW and EMFISIS instruments respectively. Values are cleaned up by averaging over the ten-second spin period. Three-dimensional electric field data is then obtained using the $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$ assumption. Notably, this assumption is taken only when the probe's spin plane is offset from the magnetic field by at least \SI{15}{\degree}. The rest of the data --- about half --- is discarded, which introduces a sampling bias against the flanks. 

A further bias is introduced by the probes' non-integer number of precessions around Earth. As of July 2014, apogee had precessed once around Earth\cite{dai_2015}. The present work considers roughly one and a half precessions; the nightside has been sampled at apogee twice as often as the dayside. 

The spatial distribution of usable data --- that is, data for which three-dimensional electric and magnetic fields are available --- is shown in \cref{fig_pos_all_sharp}. Bins are unitary in $L$ and in MLT. Distribution in magnetic latitude is not shown; the Van Allen Probes are localized to within \about\SI{10}{\degree} of the equatorial plane. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/pos_all_sharp.pdf}
    \caption[Distribution of Usable Van Allen Probe Data]{
      Three-dimensional electric field values are computed by assuming $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$. Data is discarded whenever the magnetic field falls within \SI{15}{\degree} of the spin plane, which introduces a bias against the flanks. Furthermore, the probes have completed one and a half precessions around Earth; the dayside has been sampled once at apogee, and the nightside twice. 
    }
    \label{fig_pos_all_sharp}
\end{figure}

Field measurements are transformed from GSE coordinates into the same dipole coordinates used in \cref{ch_model,ch_results}. The \z axis (parallel to the background magnetic field) is estimated using a ten-minute running average of the magnetic field measurements. The \y axis is set parallel to $\zhat \times \vec{r}$, where \vec{r} is the probe's geocentric position vector. The \x axis is then defined per $\xhat \equiv \yhat \times \zhat$. This scheme guarantees that the axes are right-handed and pairwise orthogonal\cite{liu_2009}. 

The \about1000 days of usable data are considered half an hour at a time, which gives a frequency resolution of \about\SI{0.5}{\mHz} in the discrete Fourier transform. Spectra are computed for all six field components: \dft{B_x}, \dft{B_y}, \dft{B_z}, \dft{E_x}, \dft{E_y}, and \dft{E_z}. The background magnetic field is subtracted before transforming the magnetic field components, leaving only the perturbation along each axis\footnote{As in \cref{ch_model,ch_results}, $B_x$, refers not to the full magnetic field in the \x direction, but to the perturbation in the \x direction from the zeroth-order magnetic field. The same is true for $B_y$ and $B_z$. }. Each waveform is also shifted vertically so that its mean over the thirty minute event is zero. 

Frequency-domain Poynting flux is computed from the electric and magnetic field transforms. A factor of $L^3$ compensates the compression of the flux tube, so that the resulting values are effective at the ionosphere. Poloidal and toroidal Poynting flux, respectively, are given by:
\begin{align}
  \dft{S_P} &\equiv -\frac{L^3}{\mz} \dft{E_y} \dft{B_x^*} &
  \dft{S_T} &\equiv  \frac{L^3}{\mz} \dft{E_x} \dft{B_y^*}
\end{align}

The poloidal and toroidal channels are independently checked for Pc4 waves. For each channel, a Gaussian profile is fit to the magnitude of the Poynting flux, $|\dft{S}\arg{\omega}|$. If the fit fails to converge, or if the peak of the Gaussian does not fall within \SI{5}{\mHz} of the peak value of \dft{S}, the event is discarded. Events are also discarded if their frequencies fall outside the Pc4 frequency range (\SIrange{7}{25}{\mHz}) or if their amplitudes fall below \SI{e-2}{\mW/\m\squared} (out of consideration for instrument sensitivity). 

Events are discarded if their parity is ambiguous. The electric field and the magnetic field must be coherent at a level of 0.9 or better (judged at the discrete Fourier transform point closest to the peak of the Gaussian fit). Any event within \SI{3}{\degree} of the magnetic equator is also not used; as discussed in \cref{ch_flrs}, in order to distinguish an odd mode from an even mode, it's necessary to know whether the observation is made north or south of the equator. 

\todo{How much time do the probes spend within \SI{3}{\degree} of the magnetic equator? }

A visual inspection of events shows that those with broad ``peaks'' in their spectra are typically not peaked at all --- they are noisy spectra with several spectral features grouped just closely enough to trick the fitting routine. A threshold is set at a FWHM of \SI{3}{\mHz} (equally, a standard deviation of \SI{1.27}{\mHz}). Any event with a Gaussian fit broader than that is discarded. 

Notably, events are not filtered on their phase --- that is, on the division of their energy between standing and traveling waves. This is the topic of \cref{sec_phase}. 

\todo{Are we biased in terms of \DST? What's the distribution look like for the good data and for the bad data? }

\section{Events by Mode}
  \label{sec_rate}

The filters described in \cref{sec_selection} yield 762 Pc4 events, the spatial distribution of which is shown in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp}. In each bin, the event count is normalized to the amount of usable data, per \cref{fig_pos_all_sharp}. Bins shown in white contain zero events. The rate in the bottom corner is an overall mean, weighing each bin equally. 

\todo{Bins should be weighted by $L$. The small inner bins count too much right now, and are dragging down the average. }

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/rate_all_sharp.pdf}
    \caption[Observation Rate of Pc4 Events]{
      The above figure shows the spatial distribution of all 762 observed Pc4 events. Counts are normalized by the amount of usable data in each bin. The value in the bottom-right corner is the mean of the rate in each bin; it's an estimate of how often Pc4 events would be observed if the sampling were distributed uniformly in space. Events where the poloidal and toroidal channel trigger simultaneously (\about\SI{10}{\percent} of cases) are counted as only a single event. Bins shown in white contain zero events. 
    }
    \label{fig_rate_all_sharp}
\end{figure}

Consistent with previous work, Pc4 events peak on the dayside and are rarely observed at $L < 4$. Nearly \SI{30}{\percent} of the usable data shown in \cref{fig_pos_all_sharp} is taken at $L < 4$, yet only 16 of the 762 events appear there. 

On the other hand, the present work runs contrary to Dai's 2015 result in terms of Pc4 event rates with respect to the plasmapause (not shown). His analysis found (poloidal) Pc4 pulsations to be comparably common inside and outside the plasmapause\cite{dai_2015}. In the present work, only 40 of the 762 events (\SI{5}{\percent}) fall inside the plasmasphere, despite the fact that \SI{40}{\percent} of the available data falls within the plasmasphere. The disparity is not likely due to a difference in sampling --- Dai's work, like the present work, uses data from the Van Allen Probes mission. Rather, the difference is likely due to disagreement in how the plasmapause is defined. Dai identifies the plasmapause by the maximum gradient in electron number density, while the present work takes an electron density of \SI{100}{\percc} to mark the plasmapause\footnote{Per ongoing work by Thaller. }. 

In \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp}, events are partitioned by parity and polarization, yielding 124 odd poloidal events, 214 even poloidal events, 415 odd toroidal events, and 83 even toroidal events --- a total of 836 events. The total is greater than 762 because in \about\SI{10}{\percent} of events, the poloidal and toroidal channels trigger independently. Such cases are marked as a single event in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp}, but the toroidal and poloidal events are both shown in \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mode_all_sharp.pdf}
    \caption[Observation Rate of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
      The above figure shows the spatial distribution for the same 762 events shown in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp}, partitioned by polarization and parity. The selection criteria described in \cref{sec_selection} ensure that both properties are known for all events. Event counts are normalized by the time spent by the amount of usable data in each bin. Counts shown in the bottom-left corners do not sum to 762 because some events trigger on both the poloidal channel and the toroidal channel. Bins shown in white contain zero events. 
    }
    \label{fig_mode_all_sharp}
\end{figure}

Double-triggering can be taken as a vague proxy for event quality. When the channels both trigger independently, the two events almost always (71 of 74 events) exhibit the same parity. This suggests a poloidal wave with suffient power, and a sufficient narrow spectral peak, that it can still be seen after much of its energy has rotated to the toroidal mode. 

\todo{Show plot of double-triggering events. }

Odd double-triggering events are spread broadly in MLT. They rarely occur twice on the same day (23 events spread over 20 days), are observed at comparable rates regardless of \DST. 

Even-harmonic double-triggering events, on the other hand, are mostly seen near noon, and are significantly more common when $\DST < \SI{-30}{\nT}$. Even events are also more concentrated than odd ones. The 48 even-harmonic double-events are spread over 20 days, and 35 of them are spread over just 7 days. This clustering --- where the poloidal and toroidal channel both trigger for five to ten half-hour events in the same day --- is prevalent regardless of \DST. 

The distribution of even poloidal events in \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp} is consistent with that reported by Dai\cite{dai_2015}: the observation rate is peaked at noon, and smeared across the dusk side. Notably, Dai's work focused on even poloidal waves. While he did not explicitly remove odd events from his sample, he did introduce a threshold in the magnetic field. This threshold is preferrentially satisfied by even waves (which have a magnetic field antinode near the equator) compared to odd waves (which have a magnetic field node). Dai characterized the parity of only a quarter of his events; among those, he found even harmonics to outnumber odd harmonics ten-to-one. 

In fact --- to the degree that they can be straightforwardly compared --- the distributions in \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp} also show agreement with work by Anderson\cite{anderson_1990} (using AMPTE/CCE), Kokubun\cite{kokubun_1989} (using ATS6), Liu\cite{liu_2009} (using THEMIS), and Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} (using GOES). Toroidal events dominate overall, and are primarily seen on the morning side. Poloidal events are spread broadly in MLT, with a peak near noon and distinctive odd harmonics in the early morning. 

Crucially, the present work can offer insight into how previous results fit together. Unlike events considered in previous works, those shown in \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp} have all been categorized in terms of both polarization and parity. And, perhaps more importantly, the selection process has not introduced a bias with respect to polarization or parity (at least not an obvious one). 

Not only does \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp} show that toroidal events outnumber poloidal events, but it also shows that toroidal events are predominantly odd harmonics --- as opposed to the primarily-even poloidal events. This may suggest that odd poloidal waves are more likely than even ones to be driven at low modenumber (allowing a prompt rotation of that energy to the toroidal mode). One might expect low-\azm poloidal modes to be driven by a broad, sudden change in solar wind dynamic pressure, for instance. The relative scarcity of odd poloidal observations on the dayside may indicate a short-lived source. At low \azm, energy rotates to the toroidal mode on the order of a wave period; without an ongoing source, there would be no poloidal wave to observe. 

\todo{Actually, it looks like odd poloidal waves are split about half-and-half around $\left| \frac{B_z}{B_x} \right| = 0.2$. Compressional odd modes are more common near midnight. Noncompressional ones are mostly in the morning. Even poloidal events are skewed toward low \azm. This is probably worth showing. }

\todo{Odd poloidal events are skewed nightward compared to odd toroidal events. This is not surprising. Per \cref{ch_results}, nightside poloidal events are less likely to give rise to toroidal events than those on the dayside. Even events too, actually. The toroidal distribution looks like the poloidal distribution, but skewed dayward. }

This would furthermore be consistent with even modes' apparent dearth of ground signatures\cite{takahashi_1992}. If even harmonics tend to be produced at higher modenumber than odd ones, even harmonics would be expected to produce ground signatures less often\footnote{See \cref{attenuation}. }. 

Even poloidal modes and even toroidal modes exhibit similar distributions in space: both are peaked at noon and smeared across the dusk flank, with little activity on the dawn side. This is further support for the even poloidal wave as a significant source for the even toroidal mode. 

\todo{People have talked about this. Is there a conventional explanation for dawn-dusk asymmetry? }

\todo{What else do we want to say here? Or does the rest of the commentary belong in the later sections? Note that plots in future sections are lower resolution, to make sure that the number of bins remains much smaller than the number of events. }

\todo{How does this relate to the numerical results in \cref{ch_results}? }

%Dai\cite{dai_2015} used RBSP to look at poloidal Pc4 events, with a bias in favor of the second harmonic --- 890 events. Events are most common near noon, but are spread across the day and dusk side, with a few stragglers at midnight. 

%Anderson\cite{anderson_1990} used AMPTE/CCE (mostly $L>7$, near the equator) to look at Pc4 events --- 7000 hours. Limited commentary on parity. Toroidal modes were found to outnumber poloidal modes three-to-one. ``Harmonic toroidal resonances'' are spread 0600 to 1600. ``Fundamental toroidal resonances'' (which are not mutually exclusive with harmonic ones!) appear everywhere but dusk. 

%Liu\cite{liu_2009} used THEMIS (equatorial orbit, $L$ out to \about10) to look at both poloidal and toroidal modes --- 9805 one-minute Pc4 events (?). No commentary on parity. Poloidal events are most common at noon (with another peak post-midnight) and strongest on the dusk side. Toroidal events are most common from pre-dawn to pre-noon and strongest pre-midnight and post-dawn. 

%Kokubun\cite{kokubun_1989} used ATS6 (synchronous orbit) --- \about150 events. No commentary on harmonic. Toroidal events dominate in the dawn sector. Poloidal events are spread across all MLT, with a peak in the early afternoon and Pgs in the early morning. 

%Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} used GOES13 and GOES15 (geosynchronous) to look specifically at Pgs --- 105 events. Seen from midnight to noon, with a strong peak before dawn, 0300 or so. 

%\todo{Even poloidal events and even toroidal events are distributed similarly, which is good to see, since even poloidal events give rise to even toroidal events. The relationship is less clear for odd events, though odd poloidal modes and odd toroidal modes are both least common at dusk. }

%\todo{Odd toroidal events are by far the most commonly observed. Oddly, even poloidal events are the least common. }

%\todo{Even modes are less likely to be observed on the ground? \cite{takahashi_1992} }

\section{Events by Amplitude}
  \label{sec_amp}

One might reasonable be concerned that the spatial distributions presented in \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp} are dominated by these small events, while Pc4 events large enough to be noteworthy follow a different distribution entirely. The goal of the present section is to address that concern. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/amp.pdf}
    \caption[Amplitude Distribution of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
      Amplitude distribution is shown for Pc4 events by parity and polarization, based on the peak of the spectrum's Gaussian fit. Odd poloidal events, odd toroidal events, and even toroidal events fall off sharply with increasing amplitude, while the even poloidal events are distributed more broadly --- the mean and median of the even poloidal distribution is twice as large as that of the others. 
    }
    \label{fig_amp}
\end{figure}

The distribution of event magnitudes is presented in \cref{fig_amp}, graded based on the peak of the Gaussian fit of each event's Poynting flux, $|\dft{S}\arg{\omega}|$. Mean and median values are listed for each mode. Most events are small, with Poynting flux well below \SI{0.1}{\mW/\m\squared} when mapped to the ionosphere. Only a handful of events --- 3 out of 762 --- exceed \SI{1}{\mW/\m\squared}, typically taken to be the threshold at which visible auroral arcs form. One such event is shown in \cref{fig_sample_event_strong}. 

\todo{Say something about this event? Not really clear what purpose is served by this example, actually. As a matter of curiosity, the apparent wave activity in the toroidal channel did not pass the event selection trigger because the electric and magnetic waveforms are not coherent. }

Perhaps the most notable feature of \cref{fig_amp} is the relative uniformity of the distribution of even poloidal events. If a higher magnitude threshold is imposed, as shown in \cref{fig_mode_amp}, the proportion of even poloidal events rises. 

The spatial bins in \cref{fig_mode_amp} are larger than those in \cref{sec_rate}; this change reflects an effort to keep the number of events large compared to the number of bins, even when considering relatively small subsets of the data. The larger bins --- two hours wide in MLT and divided at $L = 5$ radially --- are also used in \cref{sec_f,sec_phase}. All of the large-binned bullseye plots also share a common logarithmic color bar. 

All else being equal, one might expect the amplitude distribution of even toroidal modes to mimic that of even poloidal modes, since poloidal waves asymptotically rotate to toroidal waves. However, this does not seem to be the case. The mean and median magnitudes are more or less consistent for even toroidal modes, odd toroidal modes, and odd poloidal modes, while even poloidal modes are twice as large by those metrics. This would seem to imply that large even poloidal modes have disproportionately high modenumbers, and thus deliver energy to the toroidal mode less efficiently. This explanation is also unsatisfying, however; \cref{fig_mode_amp} shows that even poloidal and toroidal modes both become more concentrated near noon at high amplitude, suggesting a common origin.

      The above figure shows the distribution of Pc4 event observations by mode. Event magnitude cutoff is constant down each column, and increases from left to right. Stronger even events appear to become more concentrated on the dayside as the amplitude increases. Even poloidal events also become significantly more numerous relative to the other three modes, from \SI{26}{\percent} at a cutoff of \SI{0.01}{\mW/\m\squared} to \SI{41}{\percent} at \SI{0.1}{\mW/\m\squared}.

\section{Events by Frequency}
  \label{sec_f}

The difference in magnetospheric conditions between the dayside and the nightside suggest that different eigenfrequencies should arise between dayside and nightside resonances at the same $L$-shell. In fact, this phenomenon has been observed directly; the frequencies of azimuthally-drifting FLRs have been shown to change over time\cite{motoba_2015}. The effect is attributed to the difference in mass loading (and thus \Alfven speed) as a function of MLT. 

This effect was furthermore apparent in the numerical results shown in \cref{ch_results}, where \Alfven speeds on the dayside (based on empirical profiles) gave rise to significantly higher eigenfrequencies than those on the nightside. 

In \cref{fig_mode_f}, events at \SIrange{11}{17}{\mHz} (center column) do seem to be shifted nightward compared to those at \SIrange{7}{11}{\mHz} (left column), but the effect is far more pronounced than what is suggested by \cref{sec_day,sec_night}. 

\todo{We should show the runs driven at $L\sim5$ across the board. Dayside and nightside. That way we can make a fair comparison. }

As might be expected, even events are more prevalent than first-harmonic-dominated odd events higher in the Pc4 range. Events at \SIrange{7}{11}{\mHz} (left column) outnumber those at \SIrange{17}{25}{\mHz} (right column) ten-to-one or more for odd events. Among even events, the comparison is closer to three-to-one. 

The spatial distribution of odd toroidal events above \SI{17}{\mHz} warrants specific consideration. Whereas odd toroidal events overall show an overwhelming preference for the morning side, those at the top of the Pc4 frequency band instead appear from noon to dusk. It's possible that this distribution is a consequence of the small number of events (25). More likely, however, is that these are third-harmonic events, and that their source more closely resembles the source for second-harmonic waves than it does first-harmonics. 

\todo{Have people looked at third harmonics? }

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mode_f.pdf}
    \caption[Observation Rate of Pc4 Events by Mode and Frequency]{
      Event distributions above are shown in terms of mode (row) as well as event frequency (column). Mid-frequency Pc4 events are shifted somewhat nightward compared to low-frequency Pc4 events, as might be expected from the dayside's faster \Alfven speed. At the top of the Pc4 band, the distribution of odd toroidal events takes on a decidedly different character; this is likely because they are third harmonics rather than first harmonics. 
    }
    \label{fig_mode_f}
\end{figure}

The frequency distribution for each mode is shown in \cref{fig_f}. The most distinctive feature, certainly, is the frequency peak in the odd toroidal mode near \SI{9}{\mHz}. This is in line with the idea that toroidal waves exhibit frequencies that depend sharply on $L$, as discussed in \cref{ch_results}. While the Van Allen Probes' orbits do cover a large range of $L$-shells, their observations (and thus the selected events) are concentrated near apogee at $L \sim 6$. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/f.pdf}
    \caption[Frequency Distribution of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
      Frequency distributions are shown for all events, divided by harmonic and polarization. Odd toroidal events exhibit a particularly sharp peak in frequency, which is consistent with the toroidal mode's strong correlation with the local eigenfrequency. Poloidal modes appear more spread out in frequency, which is also consistent with past observations and with the numerical results in \cref{ch_results}. 
    }
    \label{fig_f}
\end{figure}

\todo{Maybe put the Gaussian fit back on top of these distributions? The distributions are not particularly Gaussian, but it gives a quantitative estimate of the spread. }

\section{Events by Phase}
  \label{sec_phase}

The phase of a wave --- that is, the phase offset between a wave's electric and magnetic fields --- indicates how its energy is partitioned between the standing and traveling wave modes. An ideal standing wave has a phase of $\pm$\SI{90}{\degree}, and thus its Poynting flux is completely imaginary. A traveling wave, on the other hand, has electric and magnetic fields in phase (or in antiphase), and is associated with a net movement of energy, usually toward the ionosphere. 

Wave phase is a topic of significant interest, since it allows an estimate to be made of the wave's lifetime. And, because phase can only be determined using simultaneous electric and magnetic field measurements, it has only recently become observable. 

\todo{Do people really care about phase, or is it just John? }

The energy per unit volume, and the rate at which energy is carried out of that volume by Poynting flux, are respectively given by:
\begin{align}
  \label{def_phase}
  U &= \frac{R^3}{2\mz} B^2 &
  \ddt U &= \frac{R^2}{\mz} E B \cos\varphi
\end{align}

Where $B$, $E$, and $R$ are the characteristic magnetic field magnitude, electric field magnitude, and length scale. The phase, $\varphi \equiv \arctan\frac{ \imag\dft{S} }{ \real\dft{S} }$, enters because only real Poynting flux carries energy. 

The ratio of the two quantities in \cref{def_phase} gives a characteristic timescale over which energy leaves the system
\begin{align}
  \label{def_tau}
  \tau &\equiv \frac{BR}{2 E \cos\varphi}
\end{align}

In the present case, magnetic fields are on the order of \SI{1}{\nT} and electric fields are on the order of \SI{1}{\mV/\m}. A reasonable scale length might be \SI{e4}{\km}, the distance traversed by the probe over the course of a half-hour event (notably, back-to-back events are unusual). 

At a phase of \SI{80}{\degree}, this timescale is comparable to a Pc4 wave period. At \SI{135}{\degree}, where energy is divided evenly between the standing and traveling wave, the timescale is only 7 seconds. A wave with a phase so far from \SI{90}{\degree} would quickly vanish unless it were constantly being replenished. 

An example of just such an event is shown in \cref{fig_sample_event_phase}.  The left column shows electric and magnetic field waveforms in blue and red respectively. The right shows the corresponding spectra: imaginary Poynting flux in magenta (corrresponding to the strength of the standing wave) and real Poynting flux in green (for the traveling wave). The black line is a Gaussian fit to the magnitude of the Poynting flux. 

The poloidal channel shows a mostly-standing wave, with a phase of \SI{79}{\degree}. The coherent activity in the compressional magnetic field implies a low azimuthal modenumber, and thus a fast rotation of energy from the poloidal mode to the toroidal mode. It's likely the rotation of energy from the poloidal mode contributes significantly to the toroidal mode's lifetime; the toroidal wave's phase is \SI{130}{\degree}, so its energy should be carried away quickly by Poynting flux.

    \caption[Waveforms and Spectra for a Pc4 Event]{
      The above is a double event, where the poloidal and toroidal channels have been independently selected as events. The poloidal channel shows a wave with most of its energy in the standing wave (phase of \SI{79}{\degree}). The toroidal mode has a significant traveling component (phase of \SI{130}{\degree}). The compressional activity implies a low modenumber, which would cause energy to rotate quickly from the poloidal mode to the toroidal mode --- evidently at a sufficient rate to replenish the losses due to the traveling mode's real Poynting flux.

\end{figure}

The selection process described in \cref{sec_selection} does not explicitly consider phase. However, the discrete Fourier transform is performed over a half-hour time span. An event with a comparatively short lifetime would be unlikely to register. It's unsurprising to see the events in \cref{fig_phase}tightly clustered near \SI{90}{\degree}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/phase.pdf}
    \caption[Phase Distribution of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
      The (absolute) phase of the selected Pc4 events is shown above. All modes show phase distributions peaked around \SI{90}{\degree}. This reflects the fact that a significant traveling wave component quickly carries energy away from an FLR. Odd events are spread more broadly in phase than even events. This is consistent with the odd modes' electric field antinode near the equator, where events are observed; the characteristic loss timescale depends on $\frac{B}{E}$ per \cref{def_tau}. 
    }
    \label{fig_phase}
\end{figure}

It's further notable in \cref{fig_phase} that the odd events are more spread out in phase than the even events. Near the equator, odd modes have an electric field antinode and a magnetic field node; per \cref{def_tau}, an odd mode's lifetime should be longer than that of an even mode with the same phase. \cref{fig_phase} uses the absolute value of each event's phase, as does \cref{fig_mode_phase}. 

Unlike amplitude (\cref{sec_amp}) and frequency (\cref{sec_f}), events of different phase do not seem to exhibit different spatial distributions, as shown in \cref{fig_mode_phase}. Comparisons are limited by the small event counts in several of the subplots; however, coarsely speaking, events with phases of \SI{75}{\degree} and worse (left column) show spatial distributions more or less in proportion with events phased \SI{85}{\degree} or better (right column).

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mode_phase.pdf}
    \caption[Observation Rate of Pc4 Events by Mode and Phase]{
      The observation rate of events is shown above, divided by (absolute) phase as well as mode. The closer a phase to \SI{90}{\degree}, the more of an event's energy is in the standing wave, rather than the traveling wave. The spatial distribution of events is more or less consistent between waves with phases very close to \SI{90}{\degree} and those with a significant traveling wave component.

\section{Discussion}

\todo{Odd poloidal events and odd toroidal events are distributed similarly in space. Even poloidal events and even toroidal events too. Toroidal events are skewed dayward compared to poloidal events, which makes sense, since on the nightside poloidal-to-toroidal rotation timescales are comparable to dissipation timescales. }

\todo{Poloidal events are mostly even. Toroidal events are mostly odd. Maybe this indicates a different preference in modenumber? }

\todo{Even poloidal events are skewed toward high amplitude compared to the other modes. Stronger even poloidal events are also skewed dayward. }

\todo{Odd toroidal events near the top of the Pc4 frequency range exhibit qualitatively different behavior from the other odd toroidal modes. They are probably third harmonics. Maybe third harmonics have a source mechanism more like second harmonics than like first. }

\todo{Most events have (absolute) phase in the range \SIrange{80}{100}{\degree}, indicating that most of the energy is in the standing wave. Odd events are spread a bit more broadly in phase. This makes sense, since they ahve an electric field antinode near the equator (where measurements are made) which makes them less susceptible to energy loss from the traveling wave. }

%\section{Poloidal Pc4 Events by Compressional Coupling}

%\todo{Low-\azm poloidal Pc4 events are coupled to the compressional mode, while high-\azm ones are not. }

%\todo{The value of $\dft{B_z}/\dft{B_x} = 0.2$ comes from Dai\cite{dai_2015}. Can we match this up to an \azm value? Sounds like a job for Tuna! }

%\todo{Collections of events at a single ground observatory (near \SI{66}{\degree}) over significant periods of time: }

%Brekke\cite{brekke_1987} looked at 523 giant pulsation events recorded at Troms{\o}, Norway, from 1929 to 1985. This spanned several solar cycles. 

%Rolf\cite{rolf_1931} collected 28 events between 1921 and 1930 at Abisko. 

%Sucksdorf\cite{sucksdorff_1939} got 150 events between 1914 and 1938 in Sodankyl{\"a}. 

%Harang\cite{harang_1941}. 97 events from 1929 to 1941. Also Troms{\o}. Note that this may have been limited by the war! 

%This comes out to something like ... events over ... years. That's about ... giant pulsations per year, observed on the ground. 

%\todo{Collections of events at an array of ground observatories: }

%Chisham and Orr\cite{chisham_1991} found 34 events from 1984 to 1987 using the EISCAT magnetometer array in scandanavia. About \SI{5}{\degree} in MLT, decent coverage from \SIrange{63}{67}{\degree} mlat. This coincides with a solar minimum. 

%Motoba, in 2015, recorded 105 giant pulsation events. The observations were carried out by a number of ground magnetometers spanning $\sim \SI{90}{\degree}$ in local time and ranging roughly \SIrange{60}{70}{\degree} magnetic latitude\cite{motoba_2015}. This was mostly during a period of low solar activity, so we expect a high count. 

%\todo{Estimate of the size of an event's footprint:}

%Velkamp\cite{veldkamp_1960} looked at a single large event and showed that, at best, it was visible over a span of \SI{5}{\degree} in magnetic latitude. 

%This is seemingly consistent with the 29 February 2012 event discussed in detail by Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} --- Motoba shows some data, but doesn't discuss this aspect in detail. 

%Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2011} computes a FWHM of about 1 in L, or \SI{2}{\degree} magnetic latitude. 

%\todo{Tying that in to RBSP observations? }

%Note that it's a bit tricky to compare ground observations to in situ observations. Large-\azm events won't make it through the ionosphere. 

%There should be no bias with respect to MLT between a ground magnetometer and RBSP. Dai's analysis was specifically chosen to take advantage of the fact that RBSP's orbit had precessed all the way around the Earth. No preferred direction. And mlat shouldn't cause issues... these are FLRs, after all. 

%How strong does an event need to be on the ground, or in the sky, to count as a giant pulsation? Motoba 2015\cite{motoba_2015} has an event which tops out on the order of \SI{10}{\nT} on the ground. It's more like \SI{5}{\mV/\m} in situ. Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2011} has similar values. 

%If peak Pg observations are at $\SI{66}{\degree}$ mlat, that corresponds to $L = 6$. Then let's suppose that peak Pg viewing is $\SI{5}{\degree}$ wide --- estimating from the work of Velkamp and Motoba. That means RBSP should see lots of Pgs when it's between $L = 5.2$ andn $L = 7.1$. Well, \SI{7.1}{\RE} is outside its apogee, but the probes spend a fair amount of time outside $L = 5.2$, since they are moving pretty slowly at that point. 

%Giant pulsations have been shown to be more numerous in times of low solar activity. That was the whole point of Brekke's seminal 1987 paper, and it's consistent with what we show in \cref{ch_results}. The RBSP observations occur during peak solar times, though it's an anemic solar peak\cite{pesnell_2016}. 

%\todo{How much time does RBSP spend outside of $L = 5.2$ (for a range of \SI{5}{\degree})? How about $L = 5.6$ to $L = 6.5$ (for FWHM of \SI{2}{\degree}? }

%Each RBSP probe spends about \SI{30}{\percent} of its orbit between $L = 5.6$ and $L = 6.5$. 

%RBSP-A and RBSP-B count as two observers. In one $\sim 5$ cases out of hundreds do they simultaneously observe a poloidal Pc4 event (although, most notably for the 2012 event which \cite{dai_2013} considers in detail), both probes do fly through the same apparent event several hours apart from one another. 

%The duration of Dai's survey is October 2012 to June 2014. Scaled by 2 probes, each of which is present in the peak Pg lshells 30\% of the time, that comes out to almost exactly one year. 

%\todo{How many fundamental mode poloidal events do we see? How many could pass for giant pulsations? How many should we expect to see? }

%\todo{How weird is it for a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4 to be monochromatic? }

%\todo{How weird is it for a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4 to be stronger than \SI{5}{\mV/\m} at the equator? }
