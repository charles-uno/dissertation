  \label{ch_rbsp}

\todo{You know what would be great for putting this numerical work in context? A nice, consistent survey that breaks down the occurrence rate of Pc4 pulsations by harmonic, etc. }

\todo{There have been some surveys in the past. Dai did a nice one last year, but his filter biased him against the fundamental mode. And only a few past works have even worried about harmonic mode... probably because it's hard to get that information unless you have both E and B. }

\todo{Furthermore, it's awkward that Pgs are identified by visual inspection. How can we say how rare they are if they aren't rigorously defined? }

%Observations show that the poloidal mode is most excited in the second harmonic\cite{cummings_1969,hughes_1978,arthur_1981,singer_1982,takahashi_1984,engebretson_1988} even when there is a strong compressional component\cite{takahashi_1987,haerendel_1999,vaivads_2001,sibeck_2012}.

\section{Event Selection}

\todo{Grab all available waveform data from RBSP --- almost 3 years for each of the two probes. }

\todo{Clean up the data by spinfitting and doing $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$. This makes about half of the data unusable (anything within \SI{15}{\degree} of the spin axis), and drops the data to a ten second cadence. }

\todo{Increment through half-hour chunks. With the ten-second cadence, anything shorter (like Dai's ten-minute events) puts too few points in the Fourier transform. }

\todo{Data is mapped from MGSE to GSE. }

\todo{The background magnetic field is determined with a ten-minute running average. }

\todo{Map the data to dipole coordinates. The \z axis is set along the background magnetic field (which is subtracted off). The azimuthal direction is along $\vec{B_0} \times \vec{r}$, as shown by Liu\cite{liu_2010}. Then the crosswise direction is defined by $\xhat \equiv \yhat \times \zhat$ to ensure orthonormality. }

\todo{Compute discrete Fourier transforms: \dft{E_x}, \dft{E_y}, \dft{B_x^*}, \dft{B_y^*}. Then get the poloidal and toroidal Poynting flux associated with the standing wave, mapped to the ionosphere (giving a factor of $L^3$ for the compression of the flux tube). }
\begin{align}
  \dft{S_P} &\equiv -\mathbb{I}\mathrm{m}\frac{L^3}{\mz} \dft{E_y} \dft{B_x^*} &
  \dft{S_T} &\equiv  \mathbb{I}\mathrm{m}\frac{L^3}{\mz} \dft{E_x} \dft{B_y^*}
\end{align}

\todo{Fit a Gaussian to the spectrum. If the fit fails (for example, due to missing or non-finite data), or if the peak of the fit is off of the peak of the actual spectrum by more than \SI{5}{\mHz}, the event is discarded. }

\todo{Threshold on frequency: if the Gaussian doesn't peak in the Pc4 band, toss it. }

\todo{Threshold on magnitude: if the Gaussian peak has an amplitude below \SI{e-2}{\mW/\m\squared}, toss it. }

\todo{Threshold on coherence: if the event doesn't have \dft{E} and \dft{B^*} coherent at 0.9 or better, toss it. }

\todo{Notably, there is NO threshold on spectral width. Broadband and messy signals are allowed. }

\todo{Sort (sorta) based on polarization: triggers are run independently for the poloidal and toroidal mode. Sometimes, both trigger simultaneously. See \cref{sec_double}. }

\todo{Sort based on parity: look at the phase of the closest DFT point to the peak of the Gaussian. Compare the complex DFT's complex phase at that point to the sign of MLAT. North of the equator (positive MLAT), the electric field should lead the magnetic field for odd modes, and lag for even modes. Deviation from exactly \SI{90}{\degree} insidates energy in the traveling wave. }

\todo{Also note the FWHM of the Gaussian, its magnitude, and the coupling between the poloidal and compressional magnetic perturbations (which indicates azimuthal modenumber): $\dft{B_z} / \dft{B_x}$. Note that Dai put a cutoff of ``compressional'' and ``noncompressional'' at $\dft{B_z} / \dft{B_x} = 0.2$ (with larger coupling meaning smaller modenumber). }

\todo{We try not to worry too much about first vs third harmonic, since we can't tell them apart except by guessing at frequency. Chisham and Orr\cite{chisham_1991} argue that around \SI{7}{\RE}, frequency around \SI{10}{\mHz} precludes higher harmonics. Or maybe look at \cite{green_1985}? }

%Green\cite{green_1979} and Cummings\cite{cummings_1969} talk about the frequencies for ideal toroidal modes.

\section{Bias in MLT}

\todo{The $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$ cleanup routine introduces a bias in MLT. Data is more likely to line up with the spin axis (and thus be discarded) on the flanks. So noon andn midnight are overrepresented. }

\todo{The data presented also makes use of a non-integer number of precessions. Each precession takes \about670 days, and there are only \about1000 days of available data. That means the nightside is sampled more heavily than the dayside at $L\about5$. }

\todo{Sampling is shown in \cref{fig_pos_all_sharp}. Rather than event counts, \cref{sec_rate,sec_double} show event rates normalized by this sampling profile. }

      %Electric field data is cleaned up by taking $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$. If the field is within \SI{15}{\degree} of the spin axis, that assumption is not reliable, so the data is discarded. Doing so biases the sample against the flanks. (The concentration near $L=6$ is due to the probes' slower movement near apogee.) \todo{Also non-integer number of precessions. }

\todo{Of the \about100 events where both the poloidal and toroidal channels triggered independently, almost all had one odd mode and one even mode. }

\todo{Collections of events at a single ground observatory (near \SI{66}{\degree}) over significant periods of time: }

Brekke\cite{brekke_1987} looked at 523 giant pulsation events recorded at Troms{\o}, Norway, from 1929 to 1985. This spanned several solar cycles. 

Rolf\cite{rolf_1931} collected 28 events between 1921 and 1930 at Abisko. 

Sucksdorf\cite{sucksdorff_1939} got 150 events between 1914 and 1938 in Sodankyl{\"a}. 

Harang\cite{harang_1941}. 97 events from 1929 to 1941. Also Troms{\o}. Note that this may have been limited by the war! 

This comes out to something like ... events over ... years. That's about ... giant pulsations per year, observed on the ground. 

\todo{Collections of events at an array of ground observatories: }

Chisham and Orr\cite{chisham_1991} found 34 events from 1984 to 1987 using the EISCAT magnetometer array in scandanavia. About \SI{5}{\degree} in MLT, decent coverage from \SIrange{63}{67}{\degree} mlat. This coincides with a solar minimum. 

Motoba, in 2015, recorded 105 giant pulsation events. The observations were carried out by a number of ground magnetometers spanning $\sim \SI{90}{\degree}$ in local time and ranging roughly \SIrange{60}{70}{\degree} magnetic latitude\cite{motoba_2015}. This was mostly during a period of low solar activity, so we expect a high count. 

\todo{Estimate of the size of an event's footprint:}

Velkamp\cite{veldkamp_1960} looked at a single large event and showed that, at best, it was visible over a span of \SI{5}{\degree} in magnetic latitude. 

This is seemingly consistent with the 29 February 2012 event discussed in detail by Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} --- Motoba shows some data, but doesn't discuss this aspect in detail. 

Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2011} computes a FWHM of about 1 in L, or \SI{2}{\degree} magnetic latitude. 

\todo{Tying that in to RBSP observations? }

Note that it's a bit tricky to compare ground observations to in situ observations. Large-\azm events won't make it through the ionosphere. 

There should be no bias with respect to MLT between a ground magnetometer and RBSP. Dai's analysis was specifically chosen to take advantage of the fact that RBSP's orbit had precessed all the way around the Earth. No preferred direction. And mlat shouldn't cause issues... these are FLRs, after all. 

How strong does an event need to be on the ground, or in the sky, to count as a giant pulsation? Motoba 2015\cite{motoba_2015} has an event which tops out on the order of \SI{10}{\nT} on the ground. It's more like \SI{5}{\mV/\m} in situ. Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2011} has similar values. 

Note that Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2013} has shown that it's OK to call something a giant pulsation even if it's not visible on the ground... though, obviously, we are comparing to ground magnetometer data for occurrence rate. 

If peak Pg observations are at $\SI{66}{\degree}$ mlat, that corresponds to $L = 6$. Then let's suppose that peak Pg viewing is $\SI{5}{\degree}$ wide --- estimating from the work of Velkamp and Motoba. That means RBSP should see lots of Pgs when it's between $L = 5.2$ andn $L = 7.1$. Well, \SI{7.1}{\RE} is outside its apogee, but the probes spend a fair amount of time outside $L = 5.2$, since they are moving pretty slowly at that point. 

Giant pulsations have been shown to be more numerous in times of low solar activity. That was the whole point of Brekke's seminal 1987 paper, and it's consistent with what we show in \cref{ch_results}. The RBSP observations occur during peak solar times, though it's an anemic solar peak\cite{pesnell_2016}. 

\todo{How much time does RBSP spend outside of $L = 5.2$ (for a range of \SI{5}{\degree})? How about $L = 5.6$ to $L = 6.5$ (for FWHM of \SI{2}{\degree}? }

Each RBSP probe spends about \SI{30}{\percent} of its orbit between $L = 5.6$ and $L = 6.5$. 

RBSP-A and RBSP-B count as two observers. In one $\sim 5$ cases out of hundreds do they simultaneously observe a poloidal Pc4 event (although, most notably for the 2012 event which \cite{dai_2013} considers in detail), both probes do fly through the same apparent event several hours apart from one another. 

The duration of Dai's survey is October 2012 to June 2014. Scaled by 2 probes, each of which is present in the peak Pg lshells 30\% of the time, that comes out to almost exactly one year. 

\todo{How many fundamental mode poloidal events do we see? How many could pass for giant pulsations? How many should we expect to see? }

\todo{How weird is it for a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4 to be monochromatic? }

\todo{How weird is it for a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4 to be stronger than \SI{5}{\mV/\m} at the equator? }
