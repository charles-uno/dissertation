  \label{ch_rbsp}

The results presented in \cref{ch_results} are interesting on their own, but
become particularly valuable when combined with observational data.
While Pc4 pulsations have previously been studied in terms of both
harmonic\cite{arthur_1981,cummings_1969,engebretson_1988,hughes_1978,
singer_1982,takahashi_1984} and 
polarization\cite{anderson_1990,dai_2015,dai_2013,kokubun_1989,liu_2009}, no
past survey has characterized each event in terms of both properties. 

This has largely been due to observational constraints. The classification of a
wave's harmonic is best carried out by computing the phase offset of the
magnetic and electric field waveforms, simultaneous in situ measurements of
which have only recently become available since the launch of
THEMIS\cite{angelopoulos_2008} in 2007 and the Van Allen
Probes\cite{stratton_2012} in 2012. The Van Allen Probes are particularly
well-suited to the study of Pc4 pulsations as their apogee of $L \sim 6$
coincides closely with eigenfrequencies in the Pc4 range. 

The present chapter uses data from the Van Allen Probes mission to survey the
occurrence rate of FLRs in the Pc4 range as a function of parity and
polarization, as well as magnitude, frequency, and phase. The tools used to
perform the present analysis --- SPEDAS and the SPICE kernel --- are publicly
available. They, along with the Python routines used to download, filter, and
plot the data, can be found at \url{https://github.com/UMN-Space-Physics}. 

%Observations show that the poloidal mode is most excited in the second harmonic\cite{cummings_1969,hughes_1978,arthur_1981,singer_1982,takahashi_1984,engebretson_1988} even when there is a strong compressional component\cite{takahashi_1987,haerendel_1999,vaivads_2001,sibeck_2012}. 

%\todo{The tools used in the present chapter --- SPEDAS and the SPICE kernel --- are publicly available. They run best with an IDL license, which is not, but they are functional using just the (free) IDL virtual machine. The code is wrapped up in a Git repository: \url{https://github.com/chizarlicious/RBSP} (maybe should make a GitHub organization to hold this code, to decouple it from my personal account?). }

\section{Sampling Bias and Event Selection}
  \label{sec_selection}

The present analysis makes use of Van Allen Probe data from October 2012 to
August 2015 --- the entire range available at the time of writing. Between the
two probes, that's just over 2000 days of observation. 

For the purposes of the present work, the two probes are taken to be
independent observers. A preliminary estimate shows that Pc4 events are
sufficiently narrow in MLT that they are rarely (\about\SI{1}{\percent}) seen
by both probes simultaneously. The events are also short-lived enough that they
are rarely seen by the two probes passing through the same region of space, no
more than a few hours apart. That said, a future investigation into the few
events that are seen by both probes could offer significant insight into the
structure and behavior of these waves. 

%For the purposes of Pc4 pulsations, it's reasonable to consider the two probes
%to be independent observers. Nearly all Pc4 events occur near apogee
%($L \gtrsim 5$), at which point the two probes are several hours apart in MLT.
%Pc4 events are typically not large enough to be seen by both probes
%simultaneously, and not long enough in duration to be seen by two probes
%passing through the same region of space several hours apart. 

%\todo{Quantify how often an event is seen by both probes? }

Electric and magnetic field data are collected using the probes'
EFW\cite{wygant_2013} and EMFISIS instruments respectively. Level 3 values are
used, averaged over the ten-second probe spin period\footnote{The fastest Pc4
pulsations have periods of \SI{45}{\second}, so a ten-second measurement
cadence easily satisfies the Nyquist rate. }. Three-dimensional
electric field data is obtained by using the $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$
assumption; at such low frequencies, this is more accurate than measurements
taken using the spin-axis boom. Notably, this assumption is taken only when the
probe's spin plane is offset from the magnetic field by at least
\SI{15}{\degree}. The rest of the data --- about half --- is discarded,
potentially introducing a sampling bias with respect to MLT and/or geomagnetic
conditions.

A further bias is introduced by the probes' non-integer number of precessions
around Earth. As of July 2014, apogee had completed one fill
precession\cite{dai_2015}. The present work considers roughly one and a half
precessions; the nightside has been sampled at apogee twice as often as the
dayside. 

The spatial distribution of usable data --- that is, data for which
three-dimensional electric and magnetic fields are available at the desired
accuracy --- is shown in
\cref{fig_pos_all_sharp}. Bins are unitary in $L$ and in MLT. The distribution
of the data in magnetic latitude is not shown; the Van Allen Probes are usually
localized to within \SI{10}{\degree} of the equatorial plane. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/pos_all_sharp.pdf}
  \caption[Distribution of Usable Van Allen Probe Data]{
    The above figure shows the spatial distribution of sampling by the Van Allen
    Probes. Bins are unitary in the polar coordinates $L$ and MLT; the spatial
    scale is indicated by the SM $X$ and $Y$ axes. The Van Allen Probes have
    precessed one and a half times around Earth, so the nightside has been
    double-sampled at apogee, resulting in a significant sampling bias. 
  }
  \label{fig_pos_all_sharp}
\end{figure}

Field measurements are transformed into the same dipole
coordinates used in \cref{ch_model,ch_results}. The background magnetic field
is estimated using a ten-minute running average of the magnetic field
measurements; that defines the \z axis. The \y axis is set parallel to
$\zhat \times \vec{r}$, where \vec{r} is the probe's geocentric position
vector. The \x axis is then defined per $\xhat \equiv \yhat \times \zhat$. This
scheme guarantees that the axes are right-handed and pairwise
orthogonal\cite{liu_2009}. 

The \about1000 days of usable data are considered half an hour at a time, which
gives a frequency resolution of \about\SI{0.5}{\mHz} in the discrete Fourier
transform. Spectra are computed for all six field components: \dft{B_x},
\dft{B_y}, \dft{B_z}, \dft{E_x}, \dft{E_y}, and \dft{E_z}. The background
magnetic field is subtracted before transforming the magnetic field components,
leaving only the perturbation along each axis\footnote{As in
\cref{ch_math,ch_model,ch_inertia,ch_results}, $B_x$, refers not to the full
magnetic field in the \x direction, but to the perturbation in the \x direction
from the zeroth-order magnetic field. The same is true for $B_y$ and $B_z$. }.
Each waveform is also shifted vertically so that its mean over the thirty
minute event is zero. 

Poynting flux along the field is computed from the electric and magnetic field
transforms. A factor of $\lr{\frac{r}{R_I}}^3$ compensates the compression of
the flux tube, so
that the resulting values are effective at the ionosphere. Poloidal and
toroidal Poynting flux, respectively, are given by:
\begin{align}
  \dft{S_P} &\equiv -\lr{\frac{r}{R_I}}^3\frac{1}{\mz} \dft{E_y} \dft{B_x^*} &
  \dft{S_T} &\equiv  \lr{\frac{r}{R_I}}^3\frac{1}{\mz} \dft{E_x} \dft{B_y^*}
\end{align}

An example event --- both electric and magnetic field measurements and real and
imaginary Poynting flux spectra --- is shown in
\cref{fig_sample_event_selection}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sample_event_selection.pdf}
  \caption[Waveforms and Spectra for a Toroidal Pc4 Event]{
    An example half-hour event is shown. On the left, components of the
    electric and magnetic field measurements are shown. On the right are the
    real and imaginary components of the corresponding Poynting flux spectra.
    A \about\SI{3}{\mHz} magnetic oscillation is visible in the poloidal
    channel, as is an electric field oscillation at \about\SI{10}{\mHz}; peaks
    appear at both frequencies in the corresponding spectrum, but no poloidal
    event is
    selected because the oscillations are not coherent. In the toroidal
    channel, a clear standing wave (phase of \SI{87}{\degree}) is evident at
    \SI{10.3}{\mHz}. The black dotted line shows a Gaussian fit of the Poynting
    flux magnitude. 
  }
  \label{fig_sample_event_selection}
\end{figure}

The poloidal and toroidal channels are independently checked for Pc4 waves. For
each channel, a Gaussian profile is fit to the magnitude of the Poynting flux,
$|\dft{S}\arg{\omega}|$. If the fit fails to converge, or if the peak of the
Gaussian does not fall within \SI{5}{\mHz} of the peak value of \dft{S}, the
event is discarded. Events are also discarded if their frequencies fall outside
the Pc4 frequency range (\SIrange{7}{25}{\mHz}) or if their amplitudes fall
below \SI{0.01}{\mW/\m\squared} (out of consideration for instrument
sensitivity). 

The magnitude threshold is set in Poynting flux instead of magnetic field
(which is more typical) in an effort to reduce bias in event selection. When
events are selected based on the magnitude of the wave magnetic field, odd
waves become more difficult to detect, due to their magnetic field node at the
equator. In fact, Dai et al mention explicitly in their 2015 survey that the
magnetic field threshold is meant to preferrentially select even
harmonics\cite{dai_2015}. 

Events are discarded if their parity is ambiguous. The electric field and the
magnetic field must be coherent at a level of 0.9 or better (judged at the
discrete Fourier transform point closest to the peak of the Gaussian fit). Any
event within \SI{3}{\degree} of the magnetic equator is also not used; as
discussed in \cref{ch_flrs}, in order to distinguish an odd mode from an even
mode, it's necessary to know whether the observation is made north or south of
the equator. 

%\todo{How much time do the probes spend within \SI{3}{\degree} of the magnetic equator? }

A visual inspection of events shows that those with broad ``peaks'' in their
spectra are typically not peaked at all --- that are bad fits of noisy or
multiharmonic data. A
threshold is set at a FWHM of \SI{3}{\mHz} (equally, a standard deviation of
\SI{1.27}{\mHz}). Any event with a Gaussian fit broader than that is discarded.

Notably, events are not filtered on their phase --- that is, on the division of
their energy between standing and traveling waves. This is the topic of
\cref{sec_phase}. 

%\todo{Are we biased in terms of \DST? What's the distribution look like for the good data and for the bad data? }

\section{Events by Mode}
  \label{sec_rate}

The filters described in \cref{sec_selection} yield 708 half-hour Pc4 events,
the spatial
distribution of which is shown in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp}. In each bin, the
event count is normalized to the amount of usable data
(\cref{fig_pos_all_sharp}). Bins shown in white contain zero events. The rate
in the bottom corner is an overall mean; it's an estimate of how often Pc4
events would be observed if the sampling were distributed uniformly in space.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/rate_all_sharp.pdf}
  \caption[Rate of Pc4 Events]{
    The above figure shows the spatial distribution of all 708 observed Pc4
    events. Counts are normalized by the amount of usable data in each bin. The
    value in the bottom-right corner is the mean of the rate in each bin, with
    the rate in each bin weighed by the area of that bin. Events where the
    poloidal and toroidal channel both trigger (\about\SI{10}{\percent} of
    events) are counted as only a single event. Bins shown in white contain
    zero events. 
  }
  \label{fig_rate_all_sharp}
\end{figure}

Consistent with previous
work\cite{anderson_1990,dai_2015,kokubun_1989,liu_2009}, Pc4 events peak on the
dayside and are rarely
observed at $L < 4$. Nearly \SI{30}{\percent} of the usable data shown in
\cref{fig_pos_all_sharp} is taken at $L < 4$, yet only 14 of the 778 events
(\SI{3}{\percent}) appear there. 

On the other hand, the present work runs contrary to recent results by Dai et
al in terms
of Pc4 event rates with respect to the plasmapause (not shown). Their analysis
found (poloidal) Pc4 pulsations to be comparably common inside and outside the
plasmapause\cite{dai_2015}. In the present work, only 35 of the 708 events
(\SI{5}{\percent}) fall inside the plasmasphere, despite the fact that
\SI{40}{\percent} of the available data falls within the plasmasphere. 
It's possible that the discrepancy is due to differing definitions of the
location of the plasmapause; Dai et al
identify the plasmapause by the maximum gradient in electron number density,
while the present work takes an electron density of \SI{100}{\percc} to mark
the plasmapause\footnote{Per ongoing work by Thaller. }. Event selection
criteria also vary significantly between the present survey and that conducted
by Dai et al --- their work shows poloidal events located based on high-cadence
magnetic field data only, while the present work also considers toroidal waves
and electric fields, but at lower cadence. 

The same events in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp} are shown again in
\cref{fig_mode_all}, partitioned by polarization and parity. In an effort to
mitigate the effects of small number statistics, the bins in
\cref{fig_mode_all} span two hours each in MLT and do not break at all in $L$. 
These same large bins are used in \cref{sec_amp_f,sec_phase}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mode_all.pdf}
  \caption[Rate of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
    The above figure shows the spatial distribution for the same 708 events
    shown in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp}, partitioned by polarization and parity.
    The selection criteria described in \cref{sec_selection} ensure that both
    properties are known for all events. Event counts are normalized by the
    time spent by the amount of usable data in each bin. Counts shown in the
    bottom-left corners do not sum to 708 because some events trigger on both
    the poloidal channel and the toroidal channel. 
  }
  \label{fig_mode_all}
\end{figure}

The distribution of even poloidal events in \cref{fig_mode_all} is
consistent with that reported by Dai et al\cite{dai_2015}: the observation rate
is peaked at noon, and extends across the dusk side. Notably, Dai et al focused
on even poloidal waves. While they did not explicitly remove odd events from
the sample, they did introduce a threshold in the magnetic field. This
threshold is
preferrentially satisfied by even waves (which have a magnetic field antinode
near the equator) compared to odd waves (which have a magnetic field node). 
Dai et al
characterized the parity of only a quarter of his events; among those, they
found even harmonics to outnumber odd harmonics ten-to-one. 

In fact --- to the degree that they can be straightforwardly compared --- the
distributions in \cref{fig_mode_all} also show agreement with work by
Anderson et al\cite{anderson_1990} (using AMPTE/CCE), Kokubun et 
al\cite{kokubun_1989}
(using ATS6), Liu et al\cite{liu_2009} (using THEMIS), and Motoba at 
al\cite{motoba_2015}
(using GOES). Toroidal events dominate overall, and are primarily seen on the
morning side. Poloidal events are spread broadly in MLT, with a peak near noon
and odd harmonics in the early morning. 

Crucially, the present work can offer insight into how previous results fit
together. Unlike events considered in previous works, those shown in
\cref{fig_mode_all} have all been categorized in terms of both
polarization and parity. And, crucially, the selection process has not
introduced a bias with respect to polarization or parity (at least not an
obvious one). 

The even events shown in \cref{fig_mode_all} show good agreement with the
numerical results in \cref{ch_results}. The even poloidal and even toroidal
distributions are qualitatively similar, as might be expected if even poloidal
waves served as a source for even toroidal waves. Even poloidal waves are more
prevalent, suggesting a typical event duration comparable to the
poloidal-to-toroidal rotation timescale. And even toroidal events are skewed
dayward compared to even poloidal events, consistent with numerical result that
a significant amount of energy on the nightside is lost to Joule dissipation
before rotating to the toroidal mode. 

The same can be said to some extent for the odd events in
\cref{fig_mode_all}, though the trends are less strong. Odd poloidal and
odd toroidal events are both scarce on the dusk flank. On the dawn flank,
poloidal events skew nightward, while toroidal events are spread broadly ---
that is, they are skewed dayward compared to the poloidal events. However, it's
unclear why odd toroidal events outnumber odd poloidal events to such a degree. 

When the 708 events are broken down by mode in \cref{fig_mode_all}, the
result is 115 odd poloidal events, 207 even poloidal events, 376 odd toroidal
events, and 80 even toroidal events --- a total of 778 events. The total is
greater than 708 because in \about\SI{10}{\percent} of events, the poloidal and
toroidal channels trigger independently. Such cases are marked as a single
event in \cref{fig_rate_all_sharp}, but the toroidal and poloidal events are
both shown in \cref{fig_mode_all}. 

Double-triggering can be taken as a crude proxy for event quality. When the
channels both trigger independently, the two events almost always
exhibit the same parity. This suggests a poloidal wave with suffient
power, and a sufficient narrow spectral peak, that it can still be seen after
much of its energy has rotated to the toroidal mode. 

Due to the small sample size of double events (22 odd and 46 even), little
can be said of their spatial distribution (not shown). They are generally
consistent with events overall: odd double events fall mostly on the
morningside and even double events fall mostly near noon. Perhaps more notable
is their pattern of occurrence in time. Odd double events rarely occur twice on
the same date; the 22 events are distributed across 19 different dates. The
even double events, on the other hand, often occur on the same date as one
another; the 46 events are spread over 19 dates, and 33 of them occur over just
6 dates.

%\end{figure}

%The spatial distribution of double events is shown in
%\cref{fig_double_rate_sharp}. The left column shows events observed with
%$\DST \geq \SI{-30}{\nT}$, normalized by the amount of usable data at
%$\DST \geq \SI{-30}{\nT}$. The right column shows events at
%$\DST < \SI{-30}{\nT}$, normalized by the amount of data with
%$\DST < \SI{-30}{\nT}$. 

%Odd double-triggering events are spread broadly in MLT. They rarely occur twice
%on the same day; the 23 events shown take place over 20 different dates. Odd
%double events occur at similar rates regardless of \DST. 

%Even-harmonic double-triggering events, on the other hand, are mostly seen near
%noon, and are significantly more common during geomagnetically active times.
%Even events are also more concentrated than odd ones. The 48 even-harmonic
%double-events shown in the bottom row of \cref{fig_double_rate_sharp} are
%spread over 20 days, and 35 of them are spread over just 7 days. This
%clustering --- where the poloidal and toroidal channel both trigger for five to
%ten half-hour events in the same day --- is prevalent regardless of \DST. 

%Not only does \cref{fig_mode_all_sharp} show that toroidal events outnumber poloidal events, but it also shows that toroidal events are predominantly odd harmonics --- as opposed to the primarily-even poloidal events. 

%This may suggest that odd poloidal waves are more likely than even ones to be driven at low modenumber (allowing a prompt rotation of that energy to the toroidal mode). One might expect low-\azm poloidal modes to be driven by a broad, sudden change in solar wind dynamic pressure, for instance. The relative scarcity of odd poloidal observations on the dayside may indicate a short-lived source. At low \azm, energy rotates to the toroidal mode on the order of a wave period; without an ongoing source, there would be no poloidal wave to observe. 

%\todo{Actually, it looks like odd poloidal waves are split about half-and-half around $\left| \frac{B_z}{B_x} \right| = 0.2$. Compressional odd modes are more common near midnight. Noncompressional ones are mostly in the morning. Even poloidal events are skewed toward low \azm. This is probably worth showing. }

%\todo{Odd poloidal events are skewed nightward compared to odd toroidal events. This is not surprising. Per \cref{ch_results}, nightside poloidal events are less likely to give rise to toroidal events than those on the dayside. Even events too, actually. The toroidal distribution looks like the poloidal distribution, but skewed dayward. }

%This would furthermore be consistent with even modes' apparent dearth of ground signatures\cite{takahashi_1992}. If even harmonics tend to be produced at higher modenumber than odd ones, even harmonics would be expected to produce ground signatures less often\footnote{See \cref{attenuation}. }. 

%Even poloidal modes and even toroidal modes exhibit similar distributions in space: both are peaked at noon and smeared across the dusk flank, with little activity on the dawn side. This is further support for the even poloidal wave as a significant source for the even toroidal mode. 

%\todo{Conventional explanation for dawn-dusk asymmetry. }

%\todo{What else do we want to say here? Or does the rest of the commentary belong in the later sections? Note that plots in future sections are lower resolution, to make sure that the number of bins remains much smaller than the number of events. }

%\todo{How does this relate to the numerical results in \cref{ch_results}? }

%Dai\cite{dai_2015} used RBSP to look at poloidal Pc4 events, with a bias in favor of the second harmonic --- 890 events. Events are most common near noon, but are spread across the day and dusk side, with a few stragglers at midnight. 

%Anderson\cite{anderson_1990} used AMPTE/CCE (mostly $L>7$, near the equator) to look at Pc4 events --- 7000 hours. Limited commentary on parity. Toroidal modes were found to outnumber poloidal modes three-to-one. ``Harmonic toroidal resonances'' are spread 0600 to 1600. ``Fundamental toroidal resonances'' (which are not mutually exclusive with harmonic ones!) appear everywhere but dusk. 

%Liu\cite{liu_2009} used THEMIS (equatorial orbit, $L$ out to \about10) to look at both poloidal and toroidal modes --- 9805 one-minute Pc4 events (?). No commentary on parity. Poloidal events are most common at noon (with another peak post-midnight) and strongest on the dusk side. Toroidal events are most common from pre-dawn to pre-noon and strongest pre-midnight and post-dawn. 

%Kokubun\cite{kokubun_1989} used ATS6 (synchronous orbit) --- \about150 events. No commentary on harmonic. Toroidal events dominate in the dawn sector. Poloidal events are spread across all MLT, with a peak in the early afternoon and Pgs in the early morning. 

%Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} used GOES13 and GOES15 (geosynchronous) to look specifically at Pgs --- 105 events. Seen from midnight to noon, with a strong peak before dawn, 0300 or so. 

%\todo{Even poloidal events and even toroidal events are distributed similarly, which is good to see, since even poloidal events give rise to even toroidal events. The relationship is less clear for odd events, though odd poloidal modes and odd toroidal modes are both least common at dusk. }

%\todo{Odd toroidal events are by far the most commonly observed. Oddly, even poloidal events are the least common. }

%\todo{Even modes are less likely to be observed on the ground? \cite{takahashi_1992} }

\section{Events by Amplitude and Frequency}
  \label{sec_amp_f}

The events shown in \cref{fig_mode_all} span a significant frequency range, not
to mention two orders of magnitude in
amplitude. One might reasonably be concerned that the spatial distributions
presented in \cref{sec_rate} are dominated by small events, while Pc4 events
large enough to be noteworthy follow a different distribution entirely. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/amp.pdf}
  \caption[Amplitude Distribution of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
    Amplitude distribution is shown for Pc4 events by parity and polarization,
    based on the peak of the spectrum's Gaussian fit. The amplitude
    distribution of even poloidal events seems to fall off less sharply than
    that of the other modes --- the median even poloidal event is more than
    half-again the median overall. 
    Error bars show the square root of the bin count. 
  }
  \label{fig_amp}
\end{figure}

%One such event is shown in \cref{fig_sample_event_strong}. 

%\todo{Say something about this event? Not really clear what purpose is served by this example, actually. As a matter of curiosity, the apparent wave activity in the toroidal channel did not pass the event selection trigger because the electric and magnetic waveforms are not coherent. }

Perhaps the most notable feature of \cref{fig_amp} is the relative uniformity
of the distribution of even poloidal events. If a higher magnitude threshold is
imposed, as shown in \cref{fig_mode_amp}, the proportion of even poloidal
events rises appreciably. 

All else being equal, one might expect the amplitude distribution of even
toroidal events to mimic that of even poloidal events, since poloidal waves
asymptotically rotate to toroidal waves. However, this does not seem to be the
case. The mean and median magnitudes are more or less consistent across even
toroidal events, odd toroidal events, and odd poloidal events, while even
poloidal events are significantly larger. 

Other than a rise in the relative count of even poloidal events, the spatial
distribution of Pc4 events is not significantly affected by the amplitude
threshold, as shown in \cref{fig_mode_amp}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mode_amp.pdf}
  \caption[Rate of Pc4 Events by Mode and Amplitude]{
    The above figure shows the distribution of Pc4 event observations by mode.
    Event magnitude cutoff is constant across each row. The spatial
    distributions are not significantly affected as a function of the amplitude
    threshold.
    However, when considering only large-amplitude events, even poloidal events
    become proportionally more common. 
  }
  \label{fig_mode_amp}
\end{figure}

Event frequencies are similarly shown in \cref{fig_f}. Odd and even events are
both concentrated toward the bottom of the Pc4 frequency range, with even
events at slightly higher frequency. This suggests that the even events are
dominated by first harmonics relatively scarce in comparison. 

The most distinctive feature of \cref{fig_f}
is the frequency peak in the odd toroidal mode near \SI{9}{\mHz}. 
Such a peak would be consistent with toroidal frequencies sharply dependent on
$L$, as discussed in \cref{ch_results} --- while the Van Allen Probes' orbits
cover a large range of $L$-shells, their observations (and thus the selected
events) are concentrated near apogee at $L \sim 6$. However, it should be noted
that event counts for the other modes are too low to make a proper comparison. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/f.pdf}
  \caption[Frequency Distribution of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
    Frequency distributions are shown for all events, divided by harmonic and
    polarization. Most events are observed near the bottom of the Pc4 range,
    with odd events slightly lower in frequency than even events. Odd toroidal
    events exhibit a peak in frequency at \about\SI{9}{\mHz}; however, it's
    difficult to compare the widths of the distributions for each mode due to
    the small sample size. 
    Error bars show the square root of the bin count. 
  }
  \label{fig_f}
\end{figure}

The difference in magnetospheric conditions between the dayside and the
nightside suggest that different eigenfrequencies should arise between dayside
and nightside resonances at the same $L$-shell. In fact, this phenomenon has
been observed directly; the frequencies of azimuthally-drifting FLRs have been
shown to change over time\cite{motoba_2015}. The effect is attributed to the
difference in mass loading (and thus \Alfven speed) as a function of MLT. 

This effect was furthermore apparent in the numerical results shown in
\cref{ch_results}, where \Alfven speeds on the dayside (based on empirical
profiles) gave rise to significantly higher eigenfrequencies than those on the
nightside. 

In \cref{fig_mode_f}, events at \SIrange{10}{16}{\mHz} (center row) are shifted
slightly nightward compared to those at \SIrange{7}{10}{\mHz} (top row), but
the effect is far less pronounced than what is suggested by
\cref{sec_day,sec_night}.

%This would seem to imply
%that large even poloidal modes have disproportionately high modenumbers, and
%thus deliver energy to the toroidal mode less efficiently. This explanation
%is unsatisfying, however; \cref{fig_mode_amp} shows that even poloidal and

\section{Events by Phase}
  \label{sec_phase}

The phase of a wave --- that is, the phase offset between a wave's electric and
magnetic fields --- indicates how its energy is partitioned between the
standing and traveling wave modes. An ideal standing wave has a phase of
$\pm$\SI{90}{\degree}, and thus its Poynting flux is completely imaginary. A
traveling wave, on the other hand, has electric and magnetic fields in phase
(or in antiphase), and is associated with a net movement of energy, usually
toward the ionosphere. 

Wave phase is a topic of significant interest, since it allows an estimate to
be made of the wave's lifetime. And, because phase can only be determined using
simultaneous electric and magnetic field measurements, it has only recently
become observable. 

%\todo{Do people really care about phase, or is it just John? }

The energy per unit volume, and the rate at which energy is carried out of that
volume by Poynting flux, are respectively given by:
\begin{align}
  \label{def_phase}
  U &= \frac{R^3}{2\mz} B^2 &
  \ddt U &= \frac{R^2}{\mz} E B \cos\varphi
\end{align}

Where $B$, $E$, and $R$ are the characteristic magnetic field magnitude,
electric field magnitude, and length scale. The phase,
$\varphi \equiv \arctan\frac{ \imag\dft{S} }{ \real\dft{S} }$, enters because
only real Poynting flux carries energy. 

The ratio of the two quantities in \cref{def_phase} gives a characteristic
timescale over which energy leaves the system
\begin{align}
  \label{def_tau}
  \tau &\equiv \frac{BR}{2 E \cos\varphi}
\end{align}

In the present case, magnetic fields are on the order of \SI{1}{\nT} and
electric fields are on the order of \SI{1}{\mV/\m}. A reasonable scale length
might be \SI{e4}{\km}, the distance traversed by the probe over the course of
a half-hour event near apogee (notably, back-to-back events are unusual). 

At a phase of \SI{80}{\degree}, this timescale is comparable to a Pc4 wave
period. At \SI{135}{\degree}, where energy is divided evenly between the
standing and traveling wave, the timescale is just 7 seconds. A wave with a
phase so far from \SI{90}{\degree} would quickly vanish unless it were
constantly being replenished. 

An example of just such an event is shown in \cref{fig_sample_event_phase}.
The left column shows electric and magnetic field waveforms in blue and red
respectively. The right shows the corresponding spectra: imaginary Poynting
flux in magenta (corrresponding to the strength of the standing wave) and real
Poynting flux in green (for the traveling wave). The black line is a Gaussian
fit to the magnitude of the Poynting flux. 

The poloidal channel shows a mostly-standing wave, with a phase of
\SI{79}{\degree}. The coherent activity in the compressional magnetic field
implies a low azimuthal modenumber, and thus a fast rotation of energy from the
poloidal mode to the toroidal mode. It's likely the rotation of energy from the
poloidal mode contributes significantly to the toroidal mode's lifetime; the
toroidal wave's phase is \SI{130}{\degree}, so its energy should be carried
away quickly by Poynting flux. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sample_event_phase.pdf}
  \caption[Waveforms and Spectra for a Double Pc4 Event]{
    The above is a double event, where the poloidal and toroidal channels have
    been independently selected as events. The poloidal channel shows a wave
    with most of its energy in the standing wave (phase of \SI{-79}{\degree}).
    The toroidal mode has a significant traveling component (phase of
    \SI{130}{\degree}). The compressional activity implies a low modenumber,
    which would cause energy to rotate quickly from the poloidal mode to the
    toroidal mode --- evidently at a sufficient rate to mitigate the losses
    due to the traveling mode's real Poynting flux. 
  }
  \label{fig_sample_event_phase}
\end{figure}

The selection process described in \cref{sec_selection} does not explicitly
consider phase. However, the discrete Fourier transform is performed over a
half-hour time span. An event with a comparatively short lifetime would be
unlikely to register. It's unsurprising to see the events in \cref{fig_phase}
are tightly clustered near \SI{90}{\degree}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/phase.pdf}
  \caption[Phase Distribution of Pc4 Events by Mode]{
    The (absolute) phase of the selected Pc4 events is shown above. All modes
    show phase distributions peaked around \SI{90}{\degree}. This reflects the
    fact that a significant traveling wave component quickly carries energy
    away from an FLR. Odd events are spread more broadly in phase than even
    events. This is consistent with the odd modes' electric field antinode near
    the equator, where events are observed; the characteristic loss timescale
    depends on $\frac{B}{E}$ per \cref{def_tau}. 
    Error bars show the square root of the bin count. 
  }
  \label{fig_phase}
\end{figure}

It's further notable in \cref{fig_phase} that the odd events are more spread
out in phase than the even events. Near the equator, odd modes have an electric
field antinode and a magnetic field node; per \cref{def_tau}, an odd mode's
lifetime should be longer than that of an even mode with the same phase. 

Unlike amplitude and frequency (\cref{sec_amp_f}), events
partitioned by phase do not exhibit appreciably different spatial
distributions, as
shown in \cref{fig_mode_phase}. 




Comparisons are limited by the small event
counts in several of the subplots; however, coarsely speaking, events with
phases of \SI{75}{\degree} and worse (left column) show spatial distributions
more or less in proportion with events phased \SI{85}{\degree} or better (right
column). \cref{fig_phase} uses the absolute value of each event's phase, as
does \cref{fig_mode_phase}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mode_phase.pdf}
  \caption[Rate of Pc4 Events by Mode and Phase]{
    The observation rate of events is shown above, divided by (absolute) phase
    as well as mode. The closer a phase to \SI{90}{\degree}, the more of an
    event's energy is in the standing wave, rather than the traveling wave. The
    spatial distribution of events is more or less consistent between waves
    with phases very close to \SI{90}{\degree} and those with a significant
    traveling wave component.

\section{Discussion}

The present chapter gives a survey of \about700 thirty-minute Pc4 events, each
characterized in terms of both parity and polarization, and selected in a way
that does not introduce an apparent bias in either property. No past study has
so thoroughly disentangled the parity and polarization of these waves.

Coarsely speaking, event distributions are found to be consistent with past
surveys. Toroidal events dominate overall, and are primarily seen on the
morning side. Poloidal events are spread broadly in MLT, with a peak near noon
and distinctive odd harmonics in the early morning. From there, the
simultaneous consideration of harmonic and polarization, combined with the
numerical results from \cref{ch_results}, offers significant insight. 

The near-noon peak of poloidal Pc4 events is shown to be due to even events (a
majority subset). Odd poloidal events occur preferrentially near midnight and
across the morning side. Similarly, toroidal events are mostly odd, and it is
specifically the odd toroidal events which occur on the morningside, while even
toroidal events peak near noon. 

The spatial distribution of even poloidal events looks much like the spatial
distribution of even toroidal events, except that the toroidal distribution is
skewed dayward compared to the poloidal. The same can be said of the odd
events. This is consistent (per \cref{ch_results}) with poloidal events as an
effective source for (same-parity) toroidal events on the dayside, and a
less-effective source on the nightside. 

As a corrolary, the distribution of odd poloidal events is found to closely
resemble the distribution of giant pulsations: midnight and morning. This
(consistent with the numerical results shown in \cref{ch_results}) suggests
that the distinctive properties attributed to giant pulsations are in fact
shared by odd poloidal Pc4s overall. 

Curiously, odd toroidal events are found to occur at a higher rate than even
ones, while the opposite is true for poloidal events. This disparity may offer
clues to the source of these waves, or hint at
a harmonic dependence in the rate of poloidal-to-toroidal rotation. 

All events are found to follow a similar amplitude distribution, except for
even poloidal events, which are notably larger. The cause is unclear. 

Event phase is also considered. Most events are shown to fall
within \SI{15}{\degree} of $\pm\SI{90}{\degree}$, indicating that
the traveling component of Pc4 pulsations is generally small compared to the
standing
component. Odd events are found to be spread more broadly in phase; this is
likely a consequence of being measured near the equator, where (due to the
electric field antinode) the lifetime of an odd event is significantly larger
than that of an even event with the same phase.

%\end{figure}

%\todo{Collections of events at a single ground observatory (near \SI{66}{\degree}) over significant periods of time: }

%Brekke\cite{brekke_1987} looked at 523 giant pulsation events recorded at Troms{\o}, Norway, from 1929 to 1985. This spanned several solar cycles. 

%Rolf\cite{rolf_1931} collected 28 events between 1921 and 1930 at Abisko. 

%Sucksdorf\cite{sucksdorff_1939} got 150 events between 1914 and 1938 in Sodankyl{\"a}. 

%Harang\cite{harang_1941}. 97 events from 1929 to 1941. Also Troms{\o}. Note that this may have been limited by the war! 

%This comes out to something like ... events over ... years. That's about ... giant pulsations per year, observed on the ground. 

%\todo{Collections of events at an array of ground observatories: }

%Chisham and Orr\cite{chisham_1991} found 34 events from 1984 to 1987 using the EISCAT magnetometer array in scandanavia. About \SI{5}{\degree} in MLT, decent coverage from \SIrange{63}{67}{\degree} mlat. This coincides with a solar minimum. 

%Motoba, in 2015, recorded 105 giant pulsation events. The observations were carried out by a number of ground magnetometers spanning $\sim \SI{90}{\degree}$ in local time and ranging roughly \SIrange{60}{70}{\degree} magnetic latitude\cite{motoba_2015}. This was mostly during a period of low solar activity, so we expect a high count. 

%\todo{Estimate of the size of an event's footprint:}

%Velkamp\cite{veldkamp_1960} looked at a single large event and showed that, at best, it was visible over a span of \SI{5}{\degree} in magnetic latitude. 

%This is seemingly consistent with the 29 February 2012 event discussed in detail by Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} --- Motoba shows some data, but doesn't discuss this aspect in detail. 

%Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2011} computes a FWHM of about 1 in L, or \SI{2}{\degree} magnetic latitude. 

%\todo{Tying that in to RBSP observations? }

%Note that it's a bit tricky to compare ground observations to in situ observations. Large-\azm events won't make it through the ionosphere. 

%There should be no bias with respect to MLT between a ground magnetometer and RBSP. Dai's analysis was specifically chosen to take advantage of the fact that RBSP's orbit had precessed all the way around the Earth. No preferred direction. And mlat shouldn't cause issues... these are FLRs, after all. 

%How strong does an event need to be on the ground, or in the sky, to count as a giant pulsation? Motoba 2015\cite{motoba_2015} has an event which tops out on the order of \SI{10}{\nT} on the ground. It's more like \SI{5}{\mV/\m} in situ. Takahashi\cite{takahashi_2011} has similar values. 

%If peak Pg observations are at $\SI{66}{\degree}$ mlat, that corresponds to $L = 6$. Then let's suppose that peak Pg viewing is $\SI{5}{\degree}$ wide --- estimating from the work of Velkamp and Motoba. That means RBSP should see lots of Pgs when it's between $L = 5.2$ andn $L = 7.1$. Well, \SI{7.1}{\RE} is outside its apogee, but the probes spend a fair amount of time outside $L = 5.2$, since they are moving pretty slowly at that point. 

%Giant pulsations have been shown to be more numerous in times of low solar activity. That was the whole point of Brekke's seminal 1987 paper, and it's consistent with what we show in \cref{ch_results}. The RBSP observations occur during peak solar times, though it's an anemic solar peak\cite{pesnell_2016}. 

%\todo{How much time does RBSP spend outside of $L = 5.2$ (for a range of \SI{5}{\degree})? How about $L = 5.6$ to $L = 6.5$ (for FWHM of \SI{2}{\degree}? }

%Each RBSP probe spends about \SI{30}{\percent} of its orbit between $L = 5.6$ and $L = 6.5$. 

%RBSP-A and RBSP-B count as two observers. In one $\sim 5$ cases out of hundreds do they simultaneously observe a poloidal Pc4 event (although, most notably for the 2012 event which \cite{dai_2013} considers in detail), both probes do fly through the same apparent event several hours apart from one another. 

%The duration of Dai's survey is October 2012 to June 2014. Scaled by 2 probes, each of which is present in the peak Pg lshells 30\% of the time, that comes out to almost exactly one year. 

%\todo{How many fundamental mode poloidal events do we see? How many could pass for giant pulsations? How many should we expect to see? }

%\todo{How weird is it for a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4 to be monochromatic? }

%\todo{How weird is it for a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4 to be stronger than \SI{5}{\mV/\m} at the equator? }
