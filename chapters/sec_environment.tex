\todo{Sketch out the goneral structure of the magnetosphere, from the ionospheric current sheet (is this too generous?) to the magnetopause (a real current sheet). Talk about where gravity dominates, where field line curvature becomes apparent, and where the moon sits in all this. }

One hundred kilometers above Earth's surface, more or less, the neutral atmosphere transitions sharply into the conducting ionosphere.

From \cite{paschmann_2003}: ``In the thermosphere, the solar ultraviolet (UV) light and energetic particles precipitating from the magnetosphere produce ionization increasing with altitude. At the same time the particle density is low enough to make the recombination times of the ionized atoms and molecules sufficiently long to allow a significant fraction of the gas to remain ionized. This produces a conducting layer of the atmosphere known as the ionosphere. The ionosphere begins at $\sim\SI{65}{\km}$, has a peak plasma density between 200 and 300 km, and eventually merges with magnetospheric regions $\sim$1000--2000 km altitudes.''

The ionospheric E region is collisionally coupled to the neutrals. This decouples the ion and electron drifts, allowing currents to flow perpendicular to the magnetic field. 

\todo{\Alfven waves couple the magnetosphere to the ionosphere\cite{paschmann_2003}. Waves travel down the field line, accelerating particles to match the magnetospheric driver (for example, increased flow velocity as a result of enhanced reconnection). Bounces off of the ionosphere. May also bounce off the driver. Builds up drag and brings about equilibrium. }

\todo{Definition of a substorm comes from \cite{akasofu_1964}. \cite{mcpherron_1973_substorms} added the growth phase (previously it was just expansion and recovery). }

Moon is at 60 RE or so. 

Tail goes back to about 100 RE. 

Ionosphere is dense enough to be shaped by gravity, but as altitude increases, magnetic field dominates.

The nitrogen density (w at sea level) drops from x at 100km to y at 1000km to z at 10**4 km.

By 10**4 km, the curvature of Earth's dipole magnetic field becomes apparent... and, between the increasing ion abundance and the decreasing strength of gravity, it dominates particle behavior.

At 10**5 km, the bow shock. On the dayside, at least. Balance between Earth's magnetic field and that of the sun. Another current sheet... This one far more intense.

Still less than halfway to the moon. That's 3e5 km.

This all takes place well within the orbit of the moon. Moon is about 60 RE away

Where are satellites? Geosynthronous? 

This with is concerned with the behavior of electromagnetic waves that propagate inside the magnetosheath, but outside the ionosphere; in fact, they play a significant role in the transport of energy from the former to the latter. 

Free electron density...

Still mostly neutrals, but collisions are so rare that they don't matter. At x, the mean free path of a neutral atom is comparable to... 

%There are a lot of interrelated things going on, so it's hard to describe Earth's environment one step at a time. Look at Scott's thesis -- he did this well, right? 

%Heliosphere, Magnetosphere, Ionosphere, Atmosphere?

%Typical solar wind density is $\sim$ \SI{5}{/\cm\cubed}. Typical solar wind velocity at Earth is \SIrange{e2}{e3}{\km/\s}. Typical solar wind particle energy is \SIrange{1}{10}{\kilo\eV}. Density can vary by $\sim$3 orders of magnitude, and velocity by one, during times of high solar activity. CMEs can also mess with the north/south component of the interplanetary magnetic field. 

At Earth's orbit, the solar magnetic field makes more-or-less a \SI{45}{\degree} angle with the \X axis. 
\footnote{Uppercase \X, \Y, and \Z are used to indicate GSE coordinates: \X points from the Earth to the Sun; \Y is perpendicular to \X in the Sun's ecliptic plane, pointing duskwards; \Z points north, out of the ecliptic plane. In later chapters, lowercase \x, \y, and \z are used to define a more-or-less analogous corodinate system with respect to Earth. }

% Solar wind is what deforms Earth's magnetic field to form the magnetosphere.

\Alfven speed. So we probably want to at least mention field line resonance here? Or do we get into that in the next chapter? Plot of \Alfven speeds and \Alfven bounce times for each profile.

\subsection{The Ionosphere}
  \label{sec_ionos}

Pedersen, Hall, and field-aligned conductivity. Do we want to get into two-cell convection? Region 1 and 2 current? 

\todo{Convection electric field. How close to Earth does it get? Don't we lose $\vec{E}=\cross{V}{B}$ when there are currents? }

``Increasing the Hall conductance allows the energy to oscillate through the inductive process rather than dissipate as Joule heating, increasing the `ringtime' of field line resonances.''\cite{waters_2013}

Scale heights. Ion/neutral composition. 

E, F layers. 

Ionospheric \Alfven resonator. This is important if we want to talk briefly about all kinds of ULF waves. 

Precipitation. Inverted V. 

\todo{Scott's thesis has a TON of detail. How much does Jesse show? }
