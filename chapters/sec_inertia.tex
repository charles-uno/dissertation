\section{Electron Inertial Effects}
  \label{sec_inertia}

As laid out in \cref{sec_tuna}, Tuna resolves neither parallel currents nor parallel electric fields. This limits the model's applicability to \todo{direct acceleration of particles? double layers? \Alfven{}ic aurorae? } and other topics closely related to field line resonance. 

Parallel currents and electric fields can be added to Tuna through the consideration of electron inertial effects in \ohmlaw:
\begin{align}
  0 &= \sz E_z - J_z & \text{becomes} & & \frac{1}{\nu} \ddt J_z &= \sz E_z - J_z
\end{align}

With the addition of the electron inertial term, it is necessary to track the parallel current independent of the parallel electric field\footnote{The parallel current $J_z$ is defined on the same points of the Yee grid as $E_z$. It is offset in time by half of a time step. }. Solving by integrating factors\footnote{The integrating factors technique is laid out explicitly for \amplaw in \cref{sec_eqns}. } gives
\begin{align}
  J_3 &\assign J_3 \, \exp \arg{ - \nu \dt } + \dt \, \frac{n e^2}{\me} E_3 \, \exp \arg{ -\nu \tfrac{\dt}{2} }
\end{align}

From there, the parallel electric field can be updated directly; \cref{e3_final} is replaced by the following: 
\begin{align}
  E_3 &\assign E_3 + c^2 \dt \, \lr{ g_{31} F^1 + g_{33} F^3 } - \frac{\dt}{\ez} J_3
\end{align}

The present section explores the complications that arise from the addition of the electron inertial term to \ohmlaw, as well as a few results that may be gleaned despite those complications. Notably -- for reasons discussed in \cref{sec_lengths} -- the results presented in \cref{ch_results} do not make use of the electron inertial term.

\subsection{The Boris Factor}
  \label{sec_boris}

With the addition of the electron inertial term, a cyclical dependence appears between \amplaw and \ohmlaw:
\begin{align}
  \ddt E_z &\sim -\frac{1}{\ez} J_z &
  & \text{and} & 
  \ddt J_z &\sim \frac{n e^2}{\me} E_z &
  & \text{so} &
  \frac{ \partial^2 }{ \partial t^2 } E_z &\sim -\op^2 E_z
\end{align}

That is, electron inertial effects come hand in hand with the plasma oscillation. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/op.pdf}
    \caption[Plasma Frequency Profile]{
      The plasma frequency reaches a peak value just under \SI{e6}{\Hz} near the equator. Outside the plasmasphere, its value is closer to \SI{e4}{\Hz}, which is still not well-resolved by Tuna's usual time step.  
    }
    \label{fig_op}
\end{figure}

As mentioned in \cref{sec_math} and shown in \cref{fig_op}, plasma oscillation is quite fast -- several orders of magnitude smaller than Tuna's time step as determined in \cref{sec_coords} (\about\SI{10}{\us}). This poses a conundrum. At Tuna's usual time step, the plasma oscillation becomes unstable within seconds\footnote{For stability, $\op \dt < 1$ is necessary. }. On the other hand, reducing the time step by three orders of magnitude to resolve the plasma oscillation is computationally infeasible; a run slated for an hour would require six weeks to complete. 

As it happens, this problem can be solved by artificially increasing the parallel electric constant above its usual value of \ez. Doing so lowers both the speed of light and the plasma frequency within the simulation. 

This technique -- and others like it -- has been widespread in numerical modeling since it was presented by Boris in 1970\cite{boris_1970}. More recently, Lysak and Song considered its use specifically for the case of electron inertial effects\cite{lysak_2001}. The following paraphrases their argument. 

Supposing that the current and electric field are oscillating at frequency $\omega$, the parallel components of \amplaw and \ohmlaw can be written
\begin{align}
  - i \omega \ez E_z &= \oomz \lr{ \, \curl{B} \, }_z - J_z & - \frac{i \omega}{\nu} J_z &= \sz E_z - J_z
\end{align}

Then, eliminating the current, the parallel electric field can be related to the curl of the magnetic field by\footnote{From \cref{def_basics}, $c^2 \equiv \frac{1}{\mz \ez}$ and $\sz \equiv \frac{n e^2}{\me \nu}$ and $\op^2 \equiv \frac{n e^2}{\me \ez}$. }
\begin{align}
  \label{boris_criterion}
  \lr{ 1 - \frac{\omega^2 - i \nu \omega}{\op^2} } E_z &= \frac{c^2}{\op^2} \lr{ \nu - i \omega } \lr{ \, \curl{B} \, }_z
\end{align}

In \cref{boris_criterion}, $\frac{c}{\op}$ is the electron inertial length. While the speed of light and the plasma frequency each depend on \ez, their ratio does not. This allows an estimation of how much the model should be affected by an artificially-large electric constant (and thus an artificially-small plasma frequency): so long as $\frac{\omega^2 - i \nu \omega}{\op^2}$ remains small compared to unity, the model should behave faithfully. 

For waves with periods of a minute or so, even perhaps-implausibly large Boris factors are allowed; for example, increasing \ez by a factor of \num{e6} gives $\left| \frac{\omega^2 + i \omega \nu}{ \op^2 } \right| \lesssim 0.01$. %In some places, this causes the speed of light to fall below the \Alfven speed; R{\"o}nnmark\cite{ronnmark_2000} terms this behavior ``anisotropic vacuum.''

\subsection{Parallel Currents and Electric Fields}
  \label{sec_inertia_fields}

As discussed in \cref{sec_implications}, parallel electric fields in this regime are expected to be six or more orders of magnitude smaller than the perpendicular electric fields. Numerical results show general agreement: in \cref{fig_electric_field_snapshots}, the parallel electric field appears comparable to its perpendicular counterparts only after its been scaled up by six orders of magnitude. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/placeholder.jpg}
    \caption[Electric Field Snapshots]{
      Parallel electric fields are smaller than perpendicular electric fields by about six orders of magnitude. As a result, parallel electric fields do not contribute significantly to $\curl{E}$ in \farlaw. 
    }
    \label{fig_electric_field_snapshots}
\end{figure}

As such, the inclusion of electron inertial effects does not appreciably impact the simulation's gross behavior; in \farlaw, \curl{E} is essentially unaffected. Side by side snapshots of the magnetic fields in runs carried out with and without electron inertial effects are not visibly distinguishable\footnote{In a sense, this is reassuring. It ensures that the present section does not cast doubt on the results presented in \cref{ch_results}, where electron inertial effects are neglected. }

Even if there is no significant feedback through \farlaw, it's informative to consider the structures that arise in parallel currents and electric fields driven by perturbations in the ring current. 

For example, the parallel electric field is at its maximum value in the ionosphere. This makes its structure qualitatively resemble the Poynting flux than the perpendicular electric field components. 

It is furthermore notable that the parallel electric field (and the parallel current that comes from it) exhibits real and imaginary components of comparable magnitude. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/current_poynting_flux.pdf}
    \caption[Current and Poynting Flux at the Ionosphere]{
      Perhaps unsurprisingly, field-aligned current structures at the ionospheric boundary line up with Poynting flux structures. The imaginary component of the current lines up with the toroidal Poynting flux (which is the product of imaginary $E_x$ and imaginary $B_y^*$), while the real current lines up with the poloidal Poynting flux ($E_y$ and $B_x^*$ are real).
    }
    \label{fig_current_poynting_flux}
\end{figure}

As mentioned in \cref{sec_tuna}, each field's real component gives its behavior in the meridional plane where the (real) driving is delivered, while imaginary components are representative of waves offset in the azimuthal direction. The Hall conductivity in the ionosphere muddles this relationship somewhat by directly coupling the perpendicular electric field components to one another; even so, the poloidal field components ($B_x$, $E_y$, and $B_z$) are overwhelmingly real while toroidal components ($E_x$ and $B_y$) are overwhelmingly imaginary. 

The parallel electric field and current defy this pattern. The real current scales more or less proportionally with the poloidal Poynting flux, and its imaginary component scales comparably with the toroidal Poynting flux. Rather than being preferrentially coupled to one mode or the other, parallel currents seem to arise wherever energy is moving along the background magnetic field. 

It bears noting further that the Poynting flux waveforms are rectified -- they primarily carry energy Earthward. The current, on the other hand, alternates between upward and downward flow. This effect presumably arises because the current is a linear quantity while the Poynting flux is quadratic: the electric and magnetic fields that make it up oscillate in phase, so their product is positive even when they are negative. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/power_density.pdf}
    \caption[Power Density at the Ionosphere]{
      While field-aligned currents can be of significant size, they are not particularly good at depositing energy in the ionosphere. Energy deposited by the Poynting flux matches closely with Joule dissipation from the perpendicular currents, while $J_z E_z$ is smaller by several orders of magnitude. 
    }
    \label{fig_power_density}
\end{figure}

It's also possible to consider the effect of parallel currents and electric fields on the ionosphere's energy budget, per Poynting's theorem:
\begin{align}
  -\ddt u &= \div{E} + \vec{J} \cdot \vec{E}
\end{align}

As shown in \cref{fig_power_density}, little energy transfer in the ionosphere is mediated by perpendicular components of the Poynting flux. The parallel component of $\vec{J} \cdot \vec{E}$ is comparably unimportant. The energy deposited in the ionosphre by the Poynting flux matches closely with the energy lost to Joule dissipation -- as it should, to conserve energy -- but according to the model, parallel currents and electric fields do not contribute significantly. 

%\todo{Parallel electric fields, supposedly, only appear at high altitude. \cite{marklund_1997,carlson_1998}. }

%\todo{Integrate up a parallel electric field to see the potential difference. Compare to the relation seen by \cite{olsson_1996}, $J_\parallel \sim \Psi_\parallel$ by a proportionality constant of \SIrange{e-8}{e-10}{\S/\meter\squared}. }

\subsection{Inertial Length Scales}
  \label{sec_lengths}

It's not quite fair to compare the parallel and perpendicular contributions to \curl{E} as was done in the previous section. Perpendicular electric fields are on the order of \SI{1}{\mV/\m}, with wavelengths on the order of \SI{e5}{\km}; they give rise to magnetic field gradients around \SI{0.1}{\nT/\s}. Parallel electric fields, closer to \SI{e-6}{\mV/\m}, would need to vary over length scales of \SI{0.1}{\km} to match with that. 

Such scales are believable. The characteristic length scale of the plasma oscillation is the electron inertial length, $\frac{c}{\op}$, which is on the order of \SI{1}{\km} in the auroral ionosphere and \SI{0.1}{\km} in the low-altitude plasmasphere. However, such lengths are not resolved by Tuna's usual grid; its resolution bottoms out closer to \SI{10}{\km}. 

That is, with the inclusion of electron inertial effects, Tuna's grid is not sufficiently fine to resolve all of the waves expected to be present. The model is prone to instability as a result; see, for example, the ``wigglies'' in the bottom row of \cref{fig_current_poynting_flux} (in the previous section). 

\cref{fig_inertial_length} shows a run with perpendicular resolution smaller than the electron inertial length, side by side with an analogous run on the usual grid. In order to carry out the inertial-scale run, several concessions were made to computational cost. The run simulates only a duration of \SI{100}{\s} (other results in previous sections and in \cref{ch_results} show \SI{300}{\s}), and the grid covers only the auroral latitudes from $L=5$ to $L=7$. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/inertial_length.pdf}
    \caption[Parallel Electric Fields by Perpendicular Grid Resolution]{
      The parallel electric field develops significant structure when the perpendicular grid resolution is smaller than the electron inertial length. Unfortunately, such runs are prohibitively expensive. The lower panel -- which still fails to resolve wave structure properly -- represents a 100-fold increase in computational time. 
    }
    \label{fig_inertial_length}
\end{figure}

Even so, the run presents a significant computational expense. Spread over 16 cores, a \SI{100}{\s} run on Tuna's usual grid takes well under an hour. The inertial-scale run barely finished in 96 hours, the cutoff at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute\footnote{Runtime goes as the inverse square of grid resolution. Not only does finer resolution require more grid cells, but it also gives rise to proportionally smaller crossing times, imposing a smaller time step. }.

The snapshot shown in \cref{fig_inertial_length} uses a perpendicular grid resolution of \SI{0.7}{\km} at the Earthward edge, which just satisfies the Nyquist rate for the minimum inertial length of \SI{1.7}{\km}. It's still too coarse. There is clearly some small-scale structure developing in the ionosphere, but it's not well resolved. The large number of ``wigglies'' portends an imminent crash. 

Electron inertial effects present a promising first-principles-based approach to investigate parallel currents and electric fields associated with field line resonances. Unfortunately, because of the large differences in scale between Pc4 pulsations and the plasma oscillation, the proper deployment of inertial effects presents a prohibitive computational expense. For this reason, results presented in \cref{ch_results} make use of the core version of Tuna presented in \cref{sec_tuna}, which does not include the effects of electron inertia.
