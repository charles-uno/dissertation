Tuna's source code, written in Fortran, is publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/UMN-Space-Physics}. The repository also includes a pair
of Python scripts: a test harness --- which automates programming environment
setup, compilation, and interfacing with the supercomputer queue --- and a
plotter. 

The present chapter uses data from the Van Allen Probes mission to survey the
occurrence rate of FLRs in the Pc4 range as a function of parity and
polarization, as well as magnitude, frequency, and phase. The tools used to
perform the present analysis --- SPEDAS and the SPICE kernel --- are publicly
available. They, along with the Python routines used to download, filter, and
plot the data, can be found at \url{https://github.com/UMN-Space-Physics}.
