  \label{ch_waves}



Pc1-2 are close to the proton cyclotron frequency. 

Pc 3-5 are field line resonance. 

Phenomenological. The boundaries are fuzzy since sometimes we want to talk about the underlying mechanisms. 

Pi2: ``Clearly linked to substorm disturbances and other impulsive dynamics are the irregularly shaped waves in the 7--25-mHz band referred to as Pi2. Recent work on these waves suggests that their periodicity reflects the spectrum of global mode excitations of the plasmasphere but there is a competing proposal that the dominant frequencies are imposed by the modulated flows in the magnetotail.''\cite{kivelson_2006}

To talk about field line resonance, we need to talk about adiabatic invariants.

\section{Pc4 Pulsations}

It seems like we should probably have a section called ``Pc4 Pulsations''... but won't we mostly be talking about the idea of FLRs?

% Gul'elmi 1974 and Kovner et al gave theoretical justification for these observations. 
% Russell and Hoppe 1981 made observations upstream of the bow shock to unify some ideas. upstream waves are driven by ion cyclotron instability, which depends on IMF magnitude. 

% Gringauz et al 1970 found that solar wind number density affects Pc3 and Pc4 periods (oppositely). The Pc4 effect is a standing question.

% Dungey 1954 had suggested KH as a wave energy source, which explained the flipping circular polarization at noon. 
% Southwood 1974 went back to the equations and came up with a reason for resonance. waves hitting the bow shock propagate in as an evanescent fast mode. when it gets to a resonant field line, the fast mode couples to the shear mode. the energy tunnels. this only happens if dissipation is finite.

% Harrold and Samson 1992 The waves probably have to be reflected by the bow shock, not by the magnetopause, to line up with the observed eigenfrequencies. 1 to 3 mHz. 

``To summarize, the general buffetting of the magnetosphere by variations in the solar wind dynamic pressure, or perhaps by sporadic magnetic reconnection, provides a broad band energy source to the magnetosphere. The magnetospheric cavity as a whole rings at its own eigenfrequencies, thus transporting energy at just those frequencies to field lines deep in the magnetosphere. Those field lines whose eigenfrequencies match one of the cavity eigenfrequencies couple to the cavity mode and resonate strongly, producing the classical field line resonance signature.\cite{hughes_1994}''

Dungey's \Alfven wave paper\cite{dungey_1954}. 

High-modenumber ULF pulsations are damped by the ionosphere, making it more difficult to observe them on the ground\cite{hughes_1976}. Small structures are also damped; resonances narrower than $\sim \SI{100}{km}$ aren't visible on the ground. 

\todo{See also Glassmeier and Stellmacher, 2000 (about small latitude), and Wright and Yeoman, 1999, Yeoman and Wright, 2001 about large \azm}

Multi-spacecraft observation of a ULF wave with very high modenumber (70+) and no apparent ground signature\cite{takahashi_2013}. 

A recent survey of Van Allen Probe data showed that Pc4 pulsations -- the poloidal ones, at least -- occur primarily during geomagnetically active times, near the plasmapause, over just a handful of hours of dayside MLT\cite{dai_2015}. This confirmed and refined older work\cite{engebretson_1987}. 

ULF waves have been shown to correlate with pulsating aurora and with chorus\cite{jaynes_2015}. It's believed that (in the case presented) substorm injection drove Pc4-5 pulsations, which modulated chorus waves, which pitch-angle scattered electrons with energies on the order of \SI{10}{\kilo\eV}. 

Energetic ring current and radiation belt particles can be accelerated by ULF waves through drift or drift-bounce resonance\cite{southwood_1976}. 

A Hall-conducting ionosphere reflects ULF waves\cite{hughes_1974}. 

``It is not clear why noncompressional [high-\azm] Pc4 poloidal waves, which are presumably driven by instability within the magnetosphere, preferrentially occur on the dayside.\cite{dai_2015}''

Poloidal and toroidal ULF polarizations are treated differently by the ionosphere\cite{greifinger_1968} (or, more recently, \cite{fujita_1988}).  

\todo{Theoretical consideration of decay vs propagation, by frequency. Lysak and Yoshikawa 2006. }

\todo{Fishbone instability. McGuire 1983, Chen 1984. Similar phenomenon, but for lab plasmas. }

An ideal poloidal mode decays to the toroidal mode in the presence of curved magnetic field lines\cite{radoski_1974} or a gradient in the \Alfven speed\cite{mann_1995}. The time is proportional to the azimuthal wavenumber\cite{mann_1995}. An analytical follow-up agreed with the numerical work\cite{mann_1997}. 

\todo{Mann gives the poloidal-to-toroidal decay time to be $\tau = \frac{d \lambda}{d \omega_A'}$, where $\lambda = \frac{\azm}{2 \pi r}$ and $\omega_A'$ is the spatial derivative of the \Alfven bounce frequency, but this doesn't seem to line up. When $\tau$ is computed using our \Alfven bounce frequencies, the result is much less than \SI{1}{\second}. Double-checking is necessary. }

Analysis of GOES data from 2008 to 2013 shows about 100 Pg events. They are concentrated on the morningside. No particular correlation with storm phase\cite{motoba_2015}. 

Recall compressional poloidal Pc4s are mostly during storm time, and noncompressional are mostly specifically during late recovery\cite{dai_2015}. Only 19 fundamental poloidal mode examples were identified from the 390 noncompressional poloidal events. 

Pgs are rare\cite{brekke_1987}. 

Most Pgs observed on the ground have \azm in the range 16 to 35\cite{takahashi_1992}. 

Poloidal Pc4s may be caused by phase space gradients\cite{dai_2013}. 

Fundamental standing waves are possibly excited by drift resonance of ions with energy around \SI{100}{\kilo\eV}\cite{thompson_2001,dai_2013}. 

``It is unclear whether other generation mechanisms of fundamental standing waves such as drift wave instability\cite{green_1979} can explain the localization of Pgs in local time (LT).''\cite{motoba_2015}

Motoba\cite{motoba_2015} found \azm valuse in the range 10 to 15 for a sample of Pgs. Previous studies\cite{rostoker_1979,glassmeier_1980,hillebrand_1982,poulter_1983} are in general agreement that Pg modenumbers fall into the range 16 to 35. 

Another past study: \cite{takahashi_1984}. Satellite data is surveyed and classified by polarization, harmonic, wavenumber, etc, in order to determine the mechanisms for generating \Alfven waves. Old, but still pretty representative, according to Motoba\cite{motoba_2015}. 

It seems to be the convention to find a Pg event on the ground, then look at satellite data. That's certainly what was done in \cite{motoba_2015}. 

Per \cite{motoba_2015}, most Pg events happen around $L=7$, but some do happen near the plasmapause, as seen(?) by \cite{green_1985}. 

``The AL distribution shown in Figure 14c are consistent with the findings of \cite{rostoker_1979} that Pgs occur as the magnetosphererecovers from previous activities (substorms).''\cite{motoba_2015} Finds this to be reasonable because it's ``very likely'' that energetic ions injected into the inner magnetosphere from the magnetotail provide energy to Pgs. 

Second harmonic poloidal waves -- as most of \cite{dai_2015}'s events are -- are unlikely to cause a Pg event on the ground\cite{takahashi_1992}. 

\cite{cummings_1969}: Standing \Alfven waves in the magnetosphere. Theoretical fundamental toroidal and poloidal modes can vary by up to \SI{30}{\percent} in frequency. 

\cite{motoba_2015} suggests that Pgs originate from the fundamental poloidal mode waves at all local times. 

First Pg observation\cite{birkeland_1901}. 

Energetic particles can get accelerated (or deaccelerated) by the wave electric field through the drift or drift-bounce resonance\cite{elkington_1999}. 

Poloidal ULF waves are capable of energizing radiation belt electrons (not ions?)  to very high energy through coherent drift/drift-bounce resonance interactions\cite{elkington_1999,ozeke_2008,mann_2013}. By multiple wave-particle interactions, poloidal ULF waves can lead to radial diffusion of radiation belt particles\cite{elkington_2003,tu_2012,ozeke_2012}. 

AMPTE/CCE data has shown a correlation between poloidal Pc4 activity and intense ring current flux near the equator\cite{engebretson_1988}. 

Pc4 pulsations are radially localized, per multiple satellite observations\cite{engebretson_1992}, and spread no more than about 8 hours MLT. They peak around $L$ of 5 to 6, with lower occurrence rate 2.5 to 9\cite{anderson_1990,liu_2009}.

Low \azm is compressional\cite{hughes_1994}. Drivers may include KH at the magnetopause\cite{chen_1974,southwood_1974,liu_2011}, variations in solar wind pressure (such as interplanetary shocks)\cite{zong_2007,zong_2009,hao_2014,degeling_2014,kessel_2008}, and waves in the foreshock region\cite{russell_1983,takahashi_2015}. 

At high \azm, the poloidal mode decouples from the compressional mode\cite{hughes_1994} and becomes guided\cite{cummings_1969}. 

Most observed guided waves are second harmonic excited by the drift-bounce resonance\cite{hughes_1978,singer_1982,takahashi_1990}. Fundamental modes, driven by drift resonance, are rarer, but have been observed\cite{dai_2013}. 

The plasmapause -- representing a sharp change in \Alfven speed -- is important for ULF waves. Waves are trapped and scattered by the effective potential well, analogous to \Schrodinger's equation\cite{lee_1998,lee_1999,dai_2009}. This has been shown theoretically\cite{klimushkin_1998,leonovich_2000,klimushkin_2004,mager_2013} (most recent is \cite{mager_2013}) and observationally\cite{takahashi_2009,takahashi_2010}. 

Because the inner magnetosphere is low-$\beta$ (that is, magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure), the strength of the compressional-poloidal coupling indicates \azm\cite{hughes_1994}. 

\todo{How so? }

\todo{Haven't read this paper yet, but it looks fun: \cite{glassmeier_2004}. }

Pc5 waves peak around $L$ of 7 to 9, too far out for RBSP\cite{anderson_1990,liu_2009}. 

It's perhaps not surprising that, finding events based on ground signatures, \azm would skew low. High-\azm waves can't penetrate the ionosphere. 

Compressional waves come from the outer boundary, propagating across field lines\cite{lysak_1992}. 

Compressional driving doesn't preclude drift or drift-bounce resonance\cite{zong_2007,zong_2009}. 

Plasmapause refilling may cause onset of the instability that drives noncompressional Pc4s\cite{engebretson_1992,liu_2013}. 

Note that Dai\cite{dai_2015} was pretty generous about what counted as a storm... anything that hits \SI{-30}{\nano\tesla}. So \cite{motoba_2015} may not have counted the same way when they found no particular correlation with storm phase. 

Compressional poloidal Pc4 pulsations are much more common during storms, but not particularly sensitive to storm phase. Noncompressional ones occur primarily during recovery\cite{dai_2015,rostoker_1979,engebretson_1992,anderson_1994}. 

In the example shown of a fundamental mode poloidal Pc4, and in the example of a higher harmonic Pc4, a mishmash of toroidal activity is present. \cite{dai_2015}, figure 8 and 9 respectively. 

Poloidal Pc4 pulsations are common inside and outside the plasmapause. Plasmapause peaks at 4.8--5 RE and 5.8--6RE\cite{dai_2015}. 

Drift resonance is the fundamental mode. Drift-bounce is higher harmonics\cite{dai_2015}. 

\todo{Do the unambiguous Pc4 events in \cite{takahashi_2011} and \cite{dai_2013} also have a mishmash of toroidal activity? }

Second harmonic: Br leads Ea by 90 degrees. Fundamental mode: Br lags Ea by 90 degrees. \cite{dai_2015}

Low-\azm waves tend to be more muddled... driven by broadband sources rather than resonance\cite{dai_2015}. 

Fundamental mode is rare. Of 390 noncompressional events, Dai identified 19 to be clearly fundamental mode and 197 to be clearly second harmonic\cite{dai_2015}. 

\todo{Fishbone instability? }

\todo{Lab \Alfven waves as LASP? }

Fast and shear (toroidal and poloidal) modes are coupled by nonzero Hall conductivity\cite{kato_1956}. 

Shear mode incident on the ionosphere, pederson current closes FAC, Hall current then generates a fast mode wave which may be detected in space or on the ground\cite{tamao_1965}. 

Toroidal mode is usually associated with external driving\cite{chen_1974,southwood_1974}. 

Guided poloidal wave arises as \azm goes to infinity\cite{radoski_1967_poloidal}. 

Observations show that the poloidal mode is most excited in the second harmonic\cite{cummings_1969,hughes_1978,arthur_1981,singer_1982,takahashi_1984,engebretson_1988} even when there is a strong compressional component\cite{takahashi_1987,haerendel_1999,vaivads_2001,sibeck_2012}. 

Theoretical justifications for why the second harmonic would be preferrentially excited in the ring current environment\cite{southwood_1976,chen_1991,cheng_1994,chan_1994}. 

The energy of the resonant particle gives \azm, recall $\omega - \azm \omega_d = 0$ or something\cite{ozeke_2001}. 

Giant pulsations happen at large \azm, and do not produce ground signatures\cite{takahashi_2013}. 

Observations of odd-mode poloidal waves... possible fundamental\cite{yang_2010,eriksson_2005}.

Observations in space indicate that Pgs are fundamental poloidal mode\cite{kokubun_1980,hillebrand_1982,kokubun_1989,takahashi_1992,glassmeier_1999}. 

\Alfven waves with small latitudinal scale\cite{glassmeier_2000} or high \azm\cite{wright_1999,yeoman_2001} are screened by the ionosphere. Attenuation factor from \cite{hughes_1976} and \cite{glassmeier_1984} DID NOT PRINT PROPERLY. LOOK IT UP. 

Typical magnitude is order of a few nT, and a few mV/m\cite{takahashi_2013}. 

Drift-wave instability\cite{hasegawa_1971,green_1979,green_1985} is also a possibility for exciting fundamental poloidal waves, though it requires cold plasma, so it could only happen in the plasmasphere. 

Fundamental poloidal mode is drift resonance, not drift bounce\cite{poulter_1983}. 

Pgs are most common during solar minimum, perhaps because of decreased mass loading of heavy ions\cite{denton_2011}. 



The \Alfven speed is computed from Kelley's low-density profile, modified to take into account the local density. The density, in turn, is the sum of a plasmaspheric profile and a high-latitude auroral profile. 
\begin{align}
  \ep &= \text{(low-density tabulated value)} + \frac{ n \bar{m} }{B_0^2}
\end{align}

\todo{What's a clean way of showing the low-density \ep that we read in? }

\todo{Does Kelley list the electric constant or the \Alfven speed? }

Where $\bar{m}$ is the ambient mean molecular mass and $B_0$ is the zeroth-order magnetic field strength, $B_0 = \SI{3.11e4}{\nano\tesla} \lr{ \frac{R_E}{r} }^3 \sqrt{ 1 + 3 \cos^2 \theta }$. Note that \SI{3.11e4}{\nano\tesla} is the value of the Earth's magnetic field at the equator on Earth's surface. 

\todo{Cite this number? Jesse just says it's a ``representative'' number. He uses \SI{30}{\micro\tesla}. }

\section{Waves in Cold Resistive Plasmas}
  \label{sec_math}

\todo{Sketch out what a dispersion relation is, why it works, why it's interesting. }

\todo{Explain that the inclusion of conductivity is novel. }

\todo{This chapter works out the sorts of waves that might be expected in the numerical model. It starts with the same equations that are used by the model -- Maxwell's equations and \ohmlaw. The resulting dispersion relation is too high-ordered for a direct solution, so several limits of interest are considered. } 

\todo{At this end of this chapter, there will be a discussion of what is specifically interesting about the findings. That doesn't really exist yet. Or... actually, should we discuss interesting things as we find them? Note that we find $\omega^2 = k^2 \va^2$ several times. }

Cold, linearlized \amplaw and \farlaw. The vector $\vec{B}$ is the perturbation to the zeroth-order magnetic field. 
\begin{align}
  \ddt \vec{B} &= -\curl{E} & \tensor{\epsilon} \cdot \ddt \vec{E} &= \oomz \curl{B} - \vec{J}
\end{align}

\ohmlaw. Electron inertial effects are included in the parallel direction. See \cref{ch_inertia}. 
\begin{align}
  \frac{\me}{n e^2} \ddt J_\parallel & = 
    \sz E_\parallel - J_\parallel &
  0 & = 
    \tensor{\sigma}_\bot \cdot \vec{E}_\bot - \vec{J}_\bot
\end{align}

Suppose that the fields and currents are resonating as $\exp \arg{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{x} - i \omega t }$. Evaluate the derivatives. Eliminate magnetic fields and currents. 
\begin{align}
  \label{disp_setup}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
%  \label{disp_para}
  & 0 = E_\parallel && + \frac{c^2}{\omega^2} \lr{ \vec{k} \, \vec{k} \cdot \vec{E} - k^2 \vec{E} }_\parallel && + \frac{i \op^2 }{\omega \lr{\nu - i \omega} } && E_\parallel \\
%  \label{disp_perp}
  & 0 = \vec{E}_\bot && + \frac{\va^2}{\omega^2} \lr{ \vec{k} \, \vec{k} \cdot \vec{E} - k^2 \vec{E} }_\bot && + \frac{i}{\ep \omega} \tensor{\sigma}_\bot \cdot && \vec{E}_\bot
\end{alignedat}
\end{align}

The above expression makes use of the vector identity $\vec{k} \times \vec{k} \times \vec{E} = \vec{k} \, \vec{k} \cdot \vec{E} - k^2 \vec{E}$. The \Alfven speed, speed of light, plasma frequency, and parallel conductivity are defined in the usual way: 
\begin{align}
  \label{def_basics}
  \va^2 & \equiv \frac{1}{\mz \ep} &
  c^2 & \equiv \frac{1}{\mz \ez} &
  \op^2 & \equiv \frac{n e^2}{\me \ez} &
  \sz & \equiv \frac{n e^2}{\me \nu}
\end{align}

Note that this definition of the \Alfven speed takes into account the displacement current correction which is important when \va approaches $c$. 

\cref{disp_setup} is then assembled into the usual dispersion tensor form:
\begin{align}
  \label{disp}
  0 &= \lr{ \tensor{ \mathbb{I} } + \frac{1}{\omega^2} \tensor{V}^2 \cdot \vec{k} \, \vec{k} - \frac{k^2}{\omega^2} \tensor{V}^2 + \frac{i}{\omega} \tensor{\Omega} } \cdot \vec{E}
\end{align}

Where $\tensor{ \mathbb{I} }$ is the identity tensor and in \x-\y-\z coordinates, 
\begin{align}
  \tensor{V}^2 &\equiv 
    \mmm{\va^2}{0}{0}
        {0}{\va^2}{0}
        {0}{0}{c^2} &
  & \text{and} &
  \tensor{\Omega} &\equiv 
    \mmm{ \frac{\sp}{\ep} }{ \frac{-\sh}{\ep} }{0}
        { \frac{\sh}{\ep} }{ \frac{\sp}{\ep} }{0}
        {0}{0}{ \frac{\op^2}{\lr{\nu - i \omega}} } 
\end{align}

In \cref{disp}, the expression in parentheses is the dispersion tensor, $\dispersiontensor$. Nontrivial solutions exist only when $\det \dispersiontensor = 0$. This gives rise to a seventh-order polynomial in $\omega$, so rather than a direct solution it's necessary to consider limits of specific interest. 

%\begin{align}
%  \dispersiontensor & = \tensor{ \mathbb{I} }
%                      + \frac{k^2}{\omega^2} 
%                        \mmm{-\va^2 \cos^2 \theta}{0}{\va^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}
%                            {0}{-\va^2}{0}
%                            {c^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{0}{-c^2 \sin^2 \theta}
%                      + \frac{i}{\omega}
%                        \mmm{ \frac{\sp}{\ep} }{-\frac{\sh}{\ep} }{0}
%                            { \frac{\sh}{\ep} }{ \frac{\sp}{\ep} }{0}
%                            {0}{0}{ \frac{\op^2}{\nu - i \omega} }

\subsection{Parallel or Perpendicular Propagation}
  \label{sec_par_perp}

\todo{Parallel propagation is ineresting because it's a naive representation of a field line resonance. Perpendicular propagation is interesting because the movement of energy across field lines is a topic of particular interest. In both cases, the cross terms in $\vec{k} \, \vec{k}$ vanish, decoupling the parallel and perpendicular polarizations. }

\todo{Without loss of generality, the wave vector $\vec{k}$ is presumed to lie in the \x-\z plane. The distinction between the azimuthal and crosswise directions is revisited later. }

\todo{ACTUALLY: does this even matter? If we keep $\phi$ in there in addition to $\theta$, does it cancel out? Seems like it should. }

%\subsection{Parallel Polarization}

In the parallel and perpendicular propagation limits respectively, the parallel factors of the determinants of \dispersiontensor are:
\begin{align}
  \label{parallel_math_setup}
  \begin{split}
  % Parallel propagation, parallel polarization. 
  0 &= \omega^2 + i \nu \omega - \op^2 \\
  % Perpendicular propagation, parallel polarization. 
  0 &= \omega^3 + i \nu \omega^2
  - \lr{ k^2 c^2 + \op^2 } \omega
  - i k^2 c^2 \nu
  \end{split}
\end{align}

Both expressions in \cref{parallel_math_setup} can be solved directly, though the solution to the (cubic) perpendicular propagation case is too long to be useful. After expanding with respect to a very large plasma frequency, the solutions can be written (for parallel and perpendicular propagation respectively): 
\begin{align}
  \label{parallel_math_final}
  \begin{split}
  % Parallel propagation, parallel polarization. 
  \omega^2 & = \op^2 - i \nu \op + ... \\
  % Perpendicular propagation, parallel polarization. 
  \omega^2 & = k^2 c^2 + \op^2 - i \nu \op + ...
  \end{split}
\end{align}

The first expression in \cref{parallel_math_final} -- describing the parallel-polarized component of a parallel-propagating wave -- doesn't describe a wave at all; there's no dependence on the wave vector $k$. Instead, it describes the plasma oscillation. The second expression is the O mode: a compressional wave, oscillating just above the plasma frequency, with a parallel electric field.

%\subsection{Perpendicular Polarization}
%  \label{sec_perp}

The perpendicular factors of the dispersion tensor's determinant, in the cases of parallel and perpendicular propagation respectively, are: 
\begin{align}
  \label{perpendicular_math_setup}
  \begin{split}
  % Parallel propagation, perpendicular polarization. 
  0 &= \omega^4 + 2 i \frac{\sp}{\ep} \omega^3
  - \lr{ 2 k^2 \va^2 + \frac{\sp^2 + \sh^2}{\ep^2} } \omega^2
  - 2 i k^2 \va^2 \frac{\sp}{\ep} \omega
  + k^4 \va^4 \\
  % Perpendicular propagation, perpendicular polarization. 
  0 &= \omega^3 + 2 i \frac{\sp}{\ep} \omega^2
  - \lr{ 2 k^2 \va^2 + \frac{\sp^2 + \sh^2}{\ep^2} } \omega
   - i k^2 \va^2 \frac{\sp}{\ep}
  \end{split}
\end{align}

First expression of \cref{perpendicular_math_setup} can be solved directly. Noting that $\pm$ and $\opm$ are independent,
\begin{align}
  % Parallel propagation, perpendicular polarization. 
  \omega = \lr{ \frac{\pm \sh - i \sp}{2 \ep} } \opm \sqrt{ k^2 \va^2 + \lr{ \frac{\pm \sh - i \sp}{2 \ep} }^2 }
\end{align}

This wave is propagating along the field line, so the Pedersen and Hall conductivities are small for the vast majority of its trajectory. Expanding, then, gives
\begin{align}
  \label{perp_final_z}
  % Parallel propagation, perpendicular polarization. 
  \omega^2 = k^2 \va^2 \opm k \va \frac{\sh \pm i \sp}{\ep} + ...
\end{align}

The second expression of \cref{perpendicular_math_setup} can also be solved directly, though its roots are impractically long. They are expanded with respect to small conductivities (as would be seen by a perpendicular-propagating wave at high altitude) and at large conductivity (representing the perpendicular-propagating wave within the ionosphere). Respectively, 
\begin{align}
  \label{perp_final_x}
  \begin{split}
  % Perpendicular propagation, perpendicular polarization. Small conductivity. 
  \omega^2 & = k^2 \va^2 \pm i k \va \frac{\sp}{\ep} + ... \\
  % Perpendicular propagation, perpendicular polarization. Large conductivity. 
  \omega^2 & = k^2 \va^2 + \lr{ \frac{\sh \pm i \sp}{\ep} }^2 + ...
  \end{split}
\end{align}

\cref{perp_final_z,perp_final_x} describe \Alfven waves: waves traveling at the \Alfven speed (shifted by the ionospheric conductivity) with electric fields perturbations perpendicular to the zeroth-order magnetic field.

\subsection{High Altitude Limit}
  \label{sec_high_alt}

In the limit of large radial distance, where the density is very low, it's reasonable to neglect the Pedersen conductivity, the Hall conductivity, and the collision rate. 

Without loss of generality, the wave vector $\vec{k}$ can be presumed to lie in the \x-\z plane\footnote{\todo{The azimuthal-propagation case is discussed in XXX.}}.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{Azimuthal Polarization}

Whereas in \cref{sec_par_perp} the parallel component of the determinant of the dispersion tensor could be factored out, the high altitude limit decouples the azimuthal component from those in the meridional plane. The azimuthal component gives, simply, 
\begin{align}
  \omega^2 & = k^2 \va^2
\end{align}

This solution is analogous to the results in \cref{sec_par_perp}: a wave propagating at the \Alfven speed, with electric field perturbation perpendicular to both the zeroth-order magnetic field and the wave vector. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{Meridional Polarization}

The meridional components of the determinant of the high-altitude limit of the dispersion tensor give: 
\begin{align}
  \label{high_meridional_setup}
  0 &= \omega^4 
  - \lr{ k_\parallel^2 \va^2 + k_\bot^2 c^2 + \op^2 } \omega^2
  + k_\parallel^2 \va^2 \op^2
\end{align}

Where $k_\parallel$ and $k_\bot$ are the parallel and crosswise components of the wave vector. The a

\cref{high_meridional_setup} is quadratic in $\omega^2$. Its solution is
\begin{align}
  \omega^2 & = \frac{1}{2} \lr{ k_\parallel^2 \va^2 + k_\bot^2 c^2 + \op^2 }
  \pm \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} \lr{ k_\parallel^2 \va^2 + k_\bot^2 c^2 + \op^2 }^2 
    - k_\parallel^2 \va^2 \op^2 }
\end{align}

Noting that $\op$ is very large, the two roots simplify to
\begin{align}
  \label{high_meridional_final}
  \begin{split}
  \omega^2 & = k_\parallel^2 \va^2 + ... \\
  \omega^2 & = k_\parallel^2 \va^2 + k_\bot^2 c^2 + \op^2 + ...
  \end{split}
\end{align}

\todo{The first part looks like an \Alfven wave. The second is faster than the plasma frequency, so we don't really care about it. }

%  \label{high_dispersion_tensor}
%  \dispersiontensor_{\infty} & = \tensor{ \mathbb{I} }

%                        \mmm{\va^2 \cos^2 \theta}{0}{-\va^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}
%                            {0}{\va^2}{0}
%                            {-c^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{0}{c^2 \sin^2 \theta}

%As $\azm$ becomes large, it puts a lower bound on the modenumber, and thus on the frequency. For an \Alfven wave, $\omega^2 = k^2 \va^2$,

%  k \ge k_\phi = \frac{\azm}{2 \pi r} \qquad \text{so} \qquad \omega \ge \frac{\azm}{2 \pi r} \va
