# ----------------------------------------------------------- Bird Cage on Head
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine a bird cage. Now take that imaginary bird cage and put it over your head. You are now the Earth, and these wires are your magnetic field lines. 

Now, sometimes someone might walk up in front of you and give the cage a good slap. Really set those wires rattling. And the person sitting behind you might flick at them -- pull a wire and let it go -- which is also going to make some noise. And really, you're going to find that this cage is sorta rattling around all the time -- when you walk, when the wind shifts, and so on. 

The slap would be something like a geomagnetic storm. The Sun belches a blob of plasma toward Earth, and when it hits us, the whole magnetosphere shakes. Pulling wires from the pack is something like a substorm. The solar wind stretches Earth's magnetic field on the night side, building up tension in the magnetic field lines, and the tension gets released impulsively, setting off waves. And, even during geomagnetically quiet times, no storm, no substorms, there are just always a few waves bouncing around the magnetosphere. 

Now, obviously, the near-Earth environment is a lot more complicated than that. Magnetic field lines twist and reconnect with each other. There are a ton of different kinds of waves -- enough that they call it the magnetospheric zoo. You've got a big shockwave where the solar wind hits Earth's magnetic field, and you've got huge sheets of electric current all over the place. 

But this is a public talk, so we're just NOT going to worry about that stuff. We're going to zoom in and just talk about the bare bones of what we need for my work. We'll see how far we can get before people fall asleep. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------- Cyclotron, Bounce, Drift Motions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's talk briefly about how charged particles behave in a magnetic field. 

There are three fundamental motions we're worried about. 

The first one -- also the fastest one -- is cyclotron motion. Particles in a constant-ish magnetic field move in a helical path. The velocity along the magnetic field line is constant, and they also move in a circular orbit around that field line. Cyclotron orbit is actually quite a bit faster than the stuff we'll be looking at -- these orbits happen many times per second. 

The second fundamental motion is bounce motion. In the magnetosphere, the magnetic field is strongest close to Earth. So a particle near the equator feels a relatively weak field. As its helical path arcs toward Earth, though, the field gets stronger. The orbit gets faster, accounting for more and more of the particle's kinetic energy. Eventually, all of the particle's kinetic energy is going into its orbit, it has none left to carry it along the field, and it bounces back. 

And it just keeps bouncing back and forth between the mirror points in the northern and southern hemispheres. 

Bounce timescales are on the order of a minute. 

The third fundamental motion is drift motion. As a particle orbits around the magnetic field line, one half of that orbit is just a LITTLE bit closer to Earth, so it feels a magnetic field that is just a LITTLE bit stronger, so it turns just a LITTLE bit tighter. The overall effect is an azimuthal drift around Earth. Positive particles drift west, and negative particles drift East, with timescales on the order of an hour. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------- Inner Magnetosphere
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These fundamental motions give us a few big structures in the inner magnetosphere -- and remember, we're not worrying about the outer magnetosphere. 

We've got the plasmapause, which is a dense -- well, "dense," compared to the rest of the magnetosphere -- torus of cold plasma which rotates along with Earth. It's mostly made of particles from the atmosphere which have been ionized by cosmic rays, UV radiation from the sun, and so on. The plasmasphere wraps all the way around Earth, and its properties depend on geomagnetic conditions, but it goes out to something like L=4. 

L is called the McIlwain parameter. It lets us index where things are in terms of Earth's dipole geometry. L=4 is the dipole field line that crosses the equator at a distance of 4 Earth radii, measured from Earth's center. 

We've also got the ring current, which is L=3 to L=5 or so. Remember that positive particles drift one way and negative particles drift the other way. That gives a net electric current. The ring current is very responsive to geomagnetic storms and substorms. It actually creates a magnetic field on Earth, and we measure that field to gauge how strong a storm is. 

There are also radiation belts. There's an inner belt around L=2 and an outer belt more like L=5. These particles are higher-energy than those that make up the ring current, but are also drift-bouncing their way around Earth. 

We're also concerned with the ionosphere, which is a transition region between the atmosphere and the magnetosphere. The ionosphere has just the right density to be electrically conductive. The biggest fields seen on the ground come from currents driven in the ionosphere. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, so the magnetosphere is full of waves, and we also have these particles bouncing around. 

Where things get interesting is when you have a wave resonating, and a particle bouncing, and they're going at the same frequency. This is called resonance, and it's something that you have an intuitive inderstanding of, even if you don't know it. 

Suppose you have a kid on a swing. If you give that kid a push, then wait an hour, and give them another push, then wait another hour, the swing isn't really going to swing. And if you grab the kid and push pull push pull push pull, that's also not going to work. The way you get the swing to work is you time the pushes to line up with the motion of the swing. 

Wave-particle resonance works the same way, except that the kid is a proton and the person pushing them is an oscillating electric field. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------- Shear/Compressional Alfven Waves
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's talk about these waves. 

If you were to unwrap a few of Earth's magnetic field lines, you would be able to see Alfven waves moving in two ways. You've got shear Alfven waves, which move ALONG the magnetic field line, and you have compressional Alfven waves, which can move ACROSS magnetic field lines. 

If you take one of these shear Alfven waves and get its wavelength just right, we call that a field line resonance (FLR). 

You can think of this like a jumprope. If you take one end of a jumprope and give it a shake, you'll see a pulse move down the length of the rope. But if you swing it at just the right frequency, the whole rope moves together, and you get a standing wave. 

As it turns out, resonance is kinda everywhere. 

These FLRs can be characterized in terms of a few different characteristics. I'm going to belabor these a little bit, because the difference between odd and even waves, poloidal and toroidal polarizations, and low and high modenumbers is sorta the whole point. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------------------------- Harmonic
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We'll start with harmonic, since we can keep the jumprope analogy. 

Usually, you spin a jumprope so that it touches the ground just once in the middle. But if you spin it faster, you can actually get the middle to become a node, and just hang there. Then you get two antinodes, one on each half, where the rope moves the most. That's the second harmonic. 

If you spin even faster, you can get a third harmonic, or a fourth harmonic. But we're just really worried about first and second harmonics, which I might call odd and even -- first harmonics being odd and second harmonics being even. 

What I've sketched out here is a series of snapshots from the first and second harmonic FLRs. The blue lines are electric field -- they have nodes at the ionosphere, due to the high conductivity. The magnetic field is red, and has its nodes and antinodes flipped compared to the electric field. 

Importantly, the red lines are not the magnetic field lines themselves. They show the strength of the PERTURBATION of the magnetic field in the perpendicular direction. The perpendicular field is big at the edges, so the magnetic field is tilted compared to the magnetic field line there. At the equator, it goes to zero, so the measured magnetic field lines up with the zeroth-order magnetic field line.  

At the equator, the first harmonic is all electric field and the second harmonic is all magnetic field. That ends up mattering because the satellites we use to observe these waves fly close to the equator. And it's only in the past decade or so that we've had probes with the ability to measure both electric and magnetic fields. 

Now if you're flying a satellite and you see the fields start to wobble, you can't exactly zoom out and check, "is this an odd harmonic or an even one?" -- although that would be super convenient. Instead, you grab your electric field waveforms, and your magnetic field waveforms, and you slide them around until they match up. 

The green dotted line shows an observer just north of the equator. For the first harmonic, that observer sees the magnetic field goes positive, then the electric field goes positive. The magnetic field goes negative, then the electric field goes negative. The magnetic field is always ahead of the magnetic field by 90 degrees. 

For the second harmonic, it's the opposite. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Polarization
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you may be wondering, "what does it look like when some parts of the magnetic field line are tilted?" And the answer is, "that's harder to draw than you might imagine."

This is where polarization comes in. 

You can have POLOIDAL waves, where the magnetic field goes like THIS, in a sorta pulsing motion. 

And you can have TOROIDAL waves, where the magnetic field goes like THIS, in a sorta twisting motion. In and out of the screen. 

The electric fields do the opposite. For the poloidal mode, where magnetic fields are pulsing in and out, the electric fields point around. For the toroidal mode, magnetic fields are twisting back and forth, and electric fields point in and out. 

The colors are just for contrast. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------------- Azimuthal Modenumber
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last property we're worried about is azimuthal modenumber. Basically, this is how many times a wave can fit around the Earth. A small azimuthal modenumber means a big wavelength, maybe wrapping all the way around Earth. At large modenumber, you fit a bunch of wavelengths around Earth in the azimuthal direction, so each wave is much smaller. 

Toroidal waves -- the twisting ones -- sorta act the same regardless of modenumber. But the poloidal ones don't. At low modenumber, poloidal waves are compressional. This means they move ACROSS magnetic field lines. But at high modenumber, the compressional component becomes evanescent, so they are guided by the field lines. At that point, they basically pretend to be shear waves. 

This ends up mattering A LOT. At low modenumber, this means you can drive FLRs from wherever you want. You can slap the birdcage, and energy will move across field lines, and end up at whichever field lines where the frequencies line up. At high modenumber, energy is sorta stuck where it is. If you want waves at L=5, you have to get that energy to L=5 before injecting it into the Alfven wave. 

This is where that wave-particle interaction comes in. 

You've got these particles drifting and bouncing around Earth. Particles with different energies go at different speeds. And you've got these Alfven waves, with oscillation times that depend on the Alfven speed, and the length of the magnetic field line. And sometimes those frequencies match up with one another, and resonate. 

You can end up energizing your resonant particles, moving them radially, or even slamming them into the atmosphere and getting auroral displays. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------------- Show a Pg Event
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking specifically at waves with periods of a minute or two, or frequencies of 7 mHz to 25 mHz. This is called the Pc4 frequency band. These waves are resonant at field lines with L of 4 to 7 or so, generally a bit outside the plasmasphere. Pc4s interact with ring current and radiation belt particles, particularly ions with energies in the neighborhood of 100 keV. 

And any time you talk about Pc4s, you also have to talk about GIANT PULSATIONS, or Pgs. Pgs are a subset of Pc4s, but they're different from Pc4s overall in several ways. 

Most Pc4s are toroidal, but Pgs are poloidal. 

Most poloidal Pc4s are even, but Pgs are odd. 

Pc4s overall peak near noon, near the peak of the solar cycle, but Pgs occur in the early morning, especially at the bottom of the solar cycle. 

Pgs are almost always observed with modenumbers in the range 16 to 35. 

Maybe the most subjective property of Pgs, but also the one that got them discovered, si their strikingly sinusoidal ground signatures. People have been picking these events out of magnetometer data by eye for over a century. 

One of the big questions behind this work is, what makes Pgs different from other Pc4s? We've got this list of distinctive properties, but we don't really know how they fit together. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------- THE MODEL... OUTLINE?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part of the reason we don't know how the different properties of giant pulsations fit together is this sort of wave is hard to model numerically. Scale lengths get small near the ionosphere, and the Alfven speed gets fast, which puts drastic constraints on the time step. Big global codes make a lot of simplifying assumptions at the ionospheric boundary, like bumping the ionosphere out from an altitude of 100 km to an altitude of 10,000 km. 

On top of that, the larger your azimuthal modenumber, the more grid cells you need in the azimuthal direction to resolve your waves in three dimensions. 

In the next part of the talk, I lay my numerical model, based on work by Bob, which is built specifically with FLRs in mind. It's got a realistic handling of the ionosphere, a novel driving mechanism, and it even models ground signatures. 

From there, we'll jump into numerical results -- if we take this model and shake it, what falls out? If we throw some energy into this model of the inner magnetosphere, how does it respond, and how does that compare to what we see with Pc4s in general or Pgs in particular? 

Ideally, I would want to take those results and match them up against a big survey of Pc4 events, where everything gets broken down by harmonic and polarization. The Van Allen Probes are pretty much perfect for this, both in terms of their instrumentation and the shape of their orbit. 

The bad new is, they've only been flying since 2012, and nobody has published a survey like that yet. 

The good news is, John is the PI on the electric field instrument. 

So I dug through that data, found ~800 Pc4 events, categorized them, and threw together some plots. It worked out surprisingly well -- the numerical results and the satellite data end up really complimenting one another. 

Polarization, harmonic, and modenumber all sorta fit together in a way nobody has put together before.
