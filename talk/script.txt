# ----------------------------------------------------------- Bird Cage on Head
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine a bird cage. Now take that imaginary bird cage and put it over your head. You are now the Earth, and these wires are your magnetic field lines. 

Now, sometimes someone might walk up in front of you and give the cage a good slap. Really set those wires rattling. And the person sitting behind you might flick at them -- pull a wire and let it go -- which is also going to make some noise. And really, you're going to find that this cage is sorta rattling around all the time -- when you walk, when the wind shifts, and so on. 

The slap would be something like a geomagnetic storm. The Sun belches a blob of plasma toward Earth, and when it hits us, the whole magnetosphere shakes. Pulling wires from the pack is something like a substorm. The solar wind stretches Earth's magnetic field on the night side, building up tension in the magnetic field lines, and the tension gets released impulsively, setting off waves. And, even during geomagnetically quiet times, no storm, no substorms, there are just always a few waves bouncing around the magnetosphere. 

Now, obviously, the near-Earth environment is a lot more complicated than that. Magnetic field lines twist and reconnect with each other. There are a ton of different kinds of waves -- enough that they call it the magnetospheric zoo. You've got a big shockwave where the solar wind hits Earth's magnetic field, and you've got huge sheets of electric current all over the place. 

But this is a public talk, so we're just NOT going to worry about that stuff. We're going to zoom in and just talk about the bare bones of what we need for my work. We'll see how far we can get before people fall asleep. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------- Cyclotron, Bounce, Drift Motions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's talk briefly about how charged particles behave in a magnetic field. 

There are three fundamental motions we're worried about. 

The first one -- also the fastest one -- is cyclotron motion. Particles in a constant-ish magnetic field move in a helical path. The velocity along the magnetic field line is constant, and they also move in a circular orbit around that field line. Cyclotron orbit is actually quite a bit faster than the stuff we'll be looking at -- these orbits happen many times per second. 

The second fundamental motion is bounce motion. In the magnetosphere, the magnetic field is strongest close to Earth. So a particle near the equator feels a relatively weak field. As its helical path arcs toward Earth, though, the field gets stronger. The orbit gets faster, accounting for more and more of the particle's kinetic energy. Eventually, all of the particle's kinetic energy is going into its orbit, it has none left to carry it along the field, and it bounces back. 

And it just keeps bouncing back and forth between the mirror points in the northern and southern hemispheres. 

Bounce timescales are on the order of a minute. 

The third fundamental motion is drift motion. As a particle orbits around the magnetic field line, one half of that orbit is just a LITTLE bit closer to Earth, so it feels a magnetic field that is just a LITTLE bit stronger, so it turns just a LITTLE bit tighter. The overall effect is an azimuthal drift around Earth. Positive particles drift west, and negative particles drift East, with timescales on the order of an hour. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------- Inner Magnetosphere
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These fundamental motions give us a few big structures in the inner magnetosphere -- and remember, we're not worrying about the outer magnetosphere. 

We've got the plasmapause, which is a dense -- well, "dense," compared to the rest of the magnetosphere -- torus of cold plasma which rotates along with Earth. It's mostly made of particles from the atmosphere which have been ionized by cosmic rays, UV radiation from the sun, and so on. The plasmasphere wraps all the way around Earth, and its properties depend on geomagnetic conditions, but it goes out to something like L=4. 

L is called the McIlwain parameter. It lets us index where things are in terms of Earth's dipole geometry. L=4 is the dipole field line that crosses the equator at a distance of 4 Earth radii, measured from Earth's center. 

We've also got the ring current, which is L=3 to L=5 or so. Remember that positive particles drift one way and negative particles drift the other way. That gives a net electric current. The ring current is very responsive to geomagnetic storms and substorms. It actually creates a magnetic field on Earth, and we measure that field to gauge how strong a storm is. 

There are also radiation belts. There's an inner belt around L=2 and an outer belt more like L=5. These particles are higher-energy than those that make up the ring current, but are also drift-bouncing their way around Earth. 

We're also concerned with the ionosphere, which is a transition region between the atmosphere and the magnetosphere. The ionosphere has just the right density to be electrically conductive. The biggest fields seen on the ground come from currents driven in the ionosphere. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, so the magnetosphere is full of waves, and we also have these particles bouncing around. 

Where things get interesting is when you have a wave resonating, and a particle bouncing, and they're going at the same frequency. This is called resonance, and it's something that you have an intuitive inderstanding of, even if you don't know it. 

Suppose you have a kid on a swing. If you give that kid a push, then wait an hour, and give them another push, then wait another hour, the swing isn't really going to swing. And if you grab the kid and push pull push pull push pull, that's also not going to work. The way you get the swing to work is you time the pushes to line up with the motion of the swing. 

Wave-particle resonance works the same way, except that the kid is a proton and the person pushing them is an oscillating electric field. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------- Shear/Compressional Alfven Waves
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's talk about these waves. 

If you were to unwrap a few of Earth's magnetic field lines, you would be able to see Alfven waves moving in two ways. You've got shear Alfven waves, which move ALONG the magnetic field line, and you have compressional Alfven waves, which can move ACROSS magnetic field lines. 

If you take one of these shear Alfven waves and get its wavelength just right, we call that a field line resonance (FLR). 

You can think of this like a jumprope. If you take one end of a jumprope and give it a shake, you'll see a pulse move down the length of the rope. But if you swing it at just the right frequency, the whole rope moves together, and you get a standing wave. 

As it turns out, resonance is kinda everywhere. 

These FLRs can be characterized in terms of a few different characteristics. I'm going to belabor these a little bit, because the difference between odd and even waves, poloidal and toroidal polarizations, and low and high modenumbers is sorta the whole point. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------------------------- Harmonic
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We'll start with harmonic, since we can keep the jumprope analogy. 

Usually, you spin a jumprope so that it touches the ground just once in the middle. But if you spin it faster, you can actually get the middle to become a node, and just hang there. Then you get two antinodes, one on each half, where the rope moves the most. That's the second harmonic. 

If you spin even faster, you can get a third harmonic, or a fourth harmonic. But we're just really worried about first and second harmonics, which I might call odd and even -- first harmonics being odd and second harmonics being even. 

What I've sketched out here is a series of snapshots from the first and second harmonic FLRs. The blue lines are electric field -- they have nodes at the ionosphere, due to the high conductivity. The magnetic field is red, and has its nodes and antinodes flipped compared to the electric field. 

Importantly, the red lines are not the magnetic field lines themselves. They show the strength of the PERTURBATION of the magnetic field in the perpendicular direction. The perpendicular field is big at the edges, so the magnetic field is tilted compared to the magnetic field line there. At the equator, it goes to zero, so the measured magnetic field lines up with the zeroth-order magnetic field line.  

At the equator, the first harmonic is all electric field and the second harmonic is all magnetic field. That ends up mattering because the satellites we use to observe these waves fly close to the equator. And it's only in the past decade or so that we've had probes with the ability to measure both electric and magnetic fields. 

Now if you're flying a satellite and you see the fields start to wobble, you can't exactly zoom out and check, "is this an odd harmonic or an even one?" -- although that would be super convenient. Instead, you grab your electric field waveforms, and your magnetic field waveforms, and you slide them around until they match up. 

The green dotted line shows an observer just north of the equator. For the first harmonic, that observer sees the magnetic field goes positive, then the electric field goes positive. The magnetic field goes negative, then the electric field goes negative. The magnetic field is always ahead of the magnetic field by 90 degrees. 

For the second harmonic, it's the opposite. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Polarization
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you may be wondering, "what does it look like when some parts of the magnetic field line are tilted?" And the answer is, "that's harder to draw than you might imagine."

This is where polarization comes in. 

You can have POLOIDAL waves, where the magnetic field goes like THIS, in a sorta pulsing motion. 

And you can have TOROIDAL waves, where the magnetic field goes like THIS, in a sorta twisting motion. In and out of the screen. 

The electric fields do the opposite. For the poloidal mode, where magnetic fields are pulsing in and out, the electric fields point around. For the toroidal mode, magnetic fields are twisting back and forth, and electric fields point in and out. 

The colors are just for contrast. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------------- Azimuthal Modenumber
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last property we're worried about is azimuthal modenumber. Basically, this is how many times a wave can fit around the Earth. A small azimuthal modenumber means a big wavelength, maybe wrapping all the way around Earth. At large modenumber, you fit a bunch of wavelengths around Earth in the azimuthal direction, so each wave is much smaller. 

Toroidal waves -- the twisting ones -- sorta act the same regardless of modenumber. But the poloidal ones don't. At low modenumber, poloidal waves are compressional. This means they move ACROSS magnetic field lines. But at high modenumber, the compressional component becomes evanescent, so they are guided by the field lines. At that point, they basically pretend to be shear waves. 

This ends up mattering A LOT. At low modenumber, this means you can drive FLRs from wherever you want. You can slap the birdcage, and energy will move across field lines, and end up at whichever field lines where the frequencies line up. At high modenumber, energy is sorta stuck where it is. If you want waves at L=5, you have to get that energy to L=5 before injecting it into the Alfven wave. 

This is where that wave-particle interaction comes in. 

You've got these particles drifting and bouncing around Earth. Particles with different energies go at different speeds. And you've got these Alfven waves, with oscillation times that depend on the Alfven speed, and the length of the magnetic field line. And sometimes those frequencies match up with one another, and resonate. 

You can end up energizing your resonant particles, moving them radially, or even slamming them into the atmosphere and getting auroral displays. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------------- Show a Pg Event
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking specifically at waves with periods of a minute or two, or frequencies of 7 mHz to 25 mHz. This is called the Pc4 frequency band. These waves are resonant at field lines with L of 4 to 7 or so, generally a bit outside the plasmasphere. Pc4s interact with ring current and radiation belt particles, particularly ions with energies in the neighborhood of 100 keV. 

And any time you talk about Pc4s, you also have to talk about GIANT PULSATIONS, or Pgs. Pgs are a subset of Pc4s, but they're different from Pc4s overall in several ways. 

Most Pc4s are toroidal, but Pgs are poloidal. 

Most poloidal Pc4s are even, but Pgs are odd. 

Pc4s overall peak near noon, near the peak of the solar cycle, but Pgs occur in the early morning, especially at the bottom of the solar cycle. 

Pgs are almost always observed with modenumbers in the range 16 to 35. 

Maybe the most subjective property of Pgs, but also the one that got them discovered, si their strikingly sinusoidal ground signatures. People have been picking these events out of magnetometer data by eye for over a century. 

One of the big questions behind this work is, what makes Pgs different from other Pc4s? We've got this list of distinctive properties, but we don't really know how they fit together. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------- THE MODEL... OUTLINE?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part of the reason we don't know how the different properties of giant pulsations fit together is this sort of wave is hard to model numerically. Scale lengths get small near the ionosphere, and the Alfven speed gets fast, which puts drastic constraints on the time step. Big global codes make a lot of simplifying assumptions at the ionospheric boundary, like bumping the ionosphere out from an altitude of 100 km to an altitude of 10,000 km. 

On top of that, the larger your azimuthal modenumber, the more grid cells you need in the azimuthal direction to resolve your waves in three dimensions. 

In the next part of the talk, I lay my numerical model, based on work by Bob, which is built specifically with FLRs in mind. It's got a realistic handling of the ionosphere, a novel driving mechanism, and it even models ground signatures. 

From there, we'll jump into numerical results -- if we take this model and shake it, what falls out? If we throw some energy into this model of the inner magnetosphere, how does it respond, and how does that compare to what we see with Pc4s in general or Pgs in particular? 

Ideally, I would want to take those results and match them up against a big survey of Pc4 events, where everything gets broken down by harmonic and polarization. The Van Allen Probes are pretty much perfect for this, both in terms of their instrumentation and the shape of their orbit. 

The bad new is, they've only been flying since 2012, and nobody has published a survey like that yet. 

The good news is, John is the PI on the electric field instrument. 

So I dug through that data, found ~800 Pc4 events, categorized them, and threw together some plots. It worked out surprisingly well -- the numerical results and the satellite data end up really complimenting one another. 

Polarization, harmonic, and modenumber all sorta fit together in a way nobody has put together before. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------ "Tuna Half" Dimensions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In trying to model FLRs, it's useful to know that they tend to be azimuthally localized. Pc4 events tend to be spread over just a few hours local time. If we're looking at an event on the dayside, we probably aren't that worried about what's happening on the nightside, and vice versa. 

This means we don't REALLY need a three-dimensional model... which is good -- remember, 3D models are computationally expensive. Instead, we can get away with two and a half dimensions. 

This means our spatial grid is two dimensional -- we're just looking at a meridional slice of the magnetosphere. But the electric and magnetic field vectors are three-dimensional. 

We finagle this by saying that everything goes as exp(i m f), where m is the azimuthal modenumber. That means we get to swap out azimuthal derivatives for a factor of i m. 

The fields we compute are complex-valued. In a hand-wavey sense, we say that the real component of each field is azimuthally lined up with the driving (which is real). And the imaginary parts of the fields are azimuthally offset by a quarter wavelength. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------------- Grid Geometry
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The geometry of this model is a bit tricky. 

Traditionally, you want your coordinate system to be orthonormal. You want x, y, and z to all come together at right angles. 

But that doesn't line up super well with the magnetosphere. We've got curved magnetic field lines, and an ionospheric boundary at more or less a constant altitude, and they don't come together at a right angle, or even at a consistent angle. 

Past studies have dealt with this by making a few different simpligying assumptions. Sometimes they say that the curvature of the magnetic field lines probably isn't that important, so they stretch out the magnetic field lines to be straight. Sometimes they say the curvature AROUND the Earth probably isn't that important, and straighten THAT out, and say that the magnetosphere looks about like a half cylinder. 

Tuna's approach -- pilfered from Bob -- is to just do the geometry right, and deal with some gross math. 

So we've got one coordinate that indexes L-shells. And we've got another coordinate that indexes ALONG the magnetic field line, and always takes a value of +1 at the northern ionosphere annd -1 at the southern ionosphere. 

These coordinates don't always come together at right angles. 

This means we have to worry about covariant and contravariant coordinates separately. We've got one basis vector that points along the dipole field, and another that points radially out at the ionosphere. And they're not quite the same. 

The math gets a little bit gross. We won't get into it here, but I think this equation is the exact point where I lost several proofreaders. 

So the grid ends up looking like this. 

Its Earthward boundary is usually set at an altitude of 100 km. The coordinates converge at the equatorial ionosphere, so we have to take a finite inner boundary, which we put at L=2. 

The outer bounadry goes at L=10, at which point the dipole approximation of Earth's field is pretty tenuous. In practice, though, wave activity is concentrated inside L=7 or so. 

At the ionosphere, we get grid resolution on the order of 10 km. Far out, it's more like 1000 km. In this figure, only every fifth grid point is shown in each direction. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------- Physical Parameter Profiles
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In terms of physical parameter profiles, we use an ideal dipole for the background magnetic field, with a strength of 31,000 nT at the equator at Earth's surface. 

We use height-resolved profiles for the Pedersen, Hall, and parallel conductivities. These are based on empirical values tabulated by Kelley, tweaked by Bob to take into account the higher mean molecular mass near the Earthward boundary. 

The perpendicular electric constant, which gives us the Alfven speed, also comes from Kelley's tabulated values, and is adjusted to into account the density of the plasmasphere and the auroral ionosphere.  

The density profile has a few knobs we can play with. The stuff I'm showing here has pretty inoffensive values -- plasmapause at L=4, density of 10,000 per cc at its base, and so on. 

Tuna has a few different ionospheric profiles. Most of the results I'm going to show will use the quiet dayside and quiet nightside profiles, which correspond to times of low solar activity, at the bottom of the solar cycle. But we'll also look briefly at how the active and quiet dayside differ, and how the active and quiet nightside differ. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------ Driving -- Show Bdrive
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The biggest difference between Tuna and Bob's work -- and its other spin-offs -- is the driving. 

The traditional driving method is to impose a wave on the outer boundary of the simulation, and watch what happens as it propagates in and resonates. This is a good proxy for an input of energy from the solar wind, or maybe substorm injection on the nightside. 

But, as we touched on before, that only works at low modenumber, where the poloidal wave is compressional. At high modenumber, once you get energy into these waves, it tends to stay where it is. So driving at the boundary tends to resonate near the boundary. 

This figure shows 16 different runs using Tuna, with driving delivered at the outer boundary. Color indicates energy density, averaged over the 300 second simulation. 

Each column uses a different ionospheric profile. Modenumber increases as you move down the rows. 

At low modenumber, these runs look great. You can see some stripes where energy is building up, indicating resonance. But as modenumber increases, this cavity opens up where compressional Alfven waves just can't go at the frequencies we're looking at. 

There's basically nothing going on in the inner magnetosphere at m=16. At m=64, the results probably aren't even physical. We're driving at the outer boundary, but waves can't propagate in, so they just get slammed right back against the boundary conditions. This has the potential to cause nonphysical reflections, which doesn't matter most of the time, but REALLY matters in this case. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sym-H
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So if we want to see high-modenumber waves in the inner magnetosphere, we need to inject the energy into the inner magnetosphere. 

We know that Pc4s interact resonantly with ring current particles, so let's try that. What if we just perturb the ring current? 

The ring current is a dynamic environment, especially during active geomagnetic times, which is when Pc4s tend to be observed. It's easy to imagine some kind of localized change in its magnitude. 

It's a bit trickier to estimate how large these perturbations might be. We can't zoom out and measure, how strong is the ring current right here, right now, and also how much does that change if we move 10,000 km in each direction? 

So we make a sorta kludgey estimate. 

We take the Sym-H index, which is a measurement of the magnetic field on EARTH as a result of the ring current. This gives us a sense for how much current is flowing overall, even if we don't know how it's distributed. 

Sym-H is basically like DST, except that DST is measured once per hour and Sym-H is once per minute. 

A measurement once per minute still isn't fast enough to tell us about the ring current perturbations that would drive Pc4s, with periods of just a minute or two. But it gets us close. So we take a Fourier transform of the Sym-H index and fit its pink noise. 

This suggests that Pc4-frequency perturbations might be responsible for Sym-H fluctuations with magnitudes on the order of 0.01 nT, which corresponds to a current in space of about a MA. 

If we suppose that's spread over an area of about a square Earth radius, that ends up being a current density on the order of 10^-4 uA/m^2. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------- Maxwell's Equations
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This brings us to Maxwell's equations. This is how we get from ring current perturbations to Alfven waves. 

The nice thing about this approach is that it's just PHYSICS. Maxwell's equations are about as fundamental as you can get. We just have to plug in the current, turn the crank, and see what happens. 

Now, turning the crank ends up being a little more complicated than we might like. 

Updating the magnetic field using Faraday's law isn't so bad. We set up C as a shorthand for the curl of the electric field, throw in a few geometric factors, and we're good. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Ampere's Law
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ampere's law is trickier. The time derivative of the electric field depends on its own future value, so we're going to need to use an integrating factor. And the Hall conductivity couples the poloidal and toroidal electric fields, so it doesn't quite work to split the vector equation up into three scalar equations. 

It turns out you're allowed to exponentiate a tensor, so that's what we do. Product rule, integrate over a time step, and we get something that, honestly, could be a lot worse. 

It gets a bit grosser when we have to actually evaluate the tensor exponential. The Hall terms turn into a rotation matrix, which makes sense, since the Hall conductivity rotates the polarization of the wave. But it still sorts fits on one line. 

When we write out the perpendicular terms, they're gross, but workable. We just have to type this in once, and check it 500 times, and then it becomes the computer's problem. 

And the parallel term doesn't look so bad! It breaks off cleanly since the rotation matrix only touches the perpendicular components. 

It seems like we should be able to plug this in and see some parallel electric fields, but it turns out that doesn't really work. The field-aligned conductivity sigma zero is really big, to the degree that sigma zero dt over epsilon zero bottoms out in the thousands. So when we exponentiate it, we get 10^-400 or something. Way too small to be stored in a double-precision value. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------------ Inertial Effects
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, basically, Tuna doesn't include parallel electric fields. They're uniformly zero. 

In my dissertation, I go on a chapter-long detour about this. I look at how we can add the electron inertial term to Ohm's law, and get into Boris factors, where we artificially lower the speed of light and the plasma frequency, and I talk about how it's OK as long as their ratio stays the same. 

And I show that this approach adds some computational expense, and it's prone to instability, but we can still get some results from this approach. 

The moral of the story ends up being, parallel currents end up about where you would expect them to -- in regions where a lot of energy is moving. We see FAC more or less in line with the magnitudes that are observed. And these terms don't appreciably affect the curl of E, so the overall behavior of the simulation doesn't change. 

Electron inertial effects don't play into the main results I want to show off, so that's as much as we're going to worry about them here. We're going to power through the last little bit of the model, and then get on to the flagship results. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------- Coupling to the Atmosphere
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, the last bit of the model is the atmospheric boundary. 

We say the atmosphere is a perfect insulator, so curl B is zero. Combine that with Maxwell's equations, div B is zero, and we find that there's a scalar magnetic potential Psi such that grad Psi is B and Psi satisfies Laplace's equation. 

So we break down the atmospheric potential in terms of harmonics. We solve Laplace's equation numerically, use the conductive Earth as a bottom boundary condition. The top boundary condition is a thin horizontal current sheet representing the E layer of the atmosphere. 

Magnetic fields at the top of the atmosphere are plugged back into the simulation per Ampere's law. 

Fields at the bottom of the atmosphere show us the ground signatures that arise from these FLRs.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------- Small Modenumber Snapshots
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, so now let's look at some results! 

The first thing I want to look at is just some snapshots from a pair of runs. 

We'll flip back and forth between them a few times. 

These runs are both driven at 22 mHz, so a period of 45 seconds. The driving is delivered in a Gaussian around L=5. They both use the quiet dayside ionosphere. 

This shows the whole dipole slice, so Earth fits right in this cavity here. 

The three columns show the poloida, toroidal, and compressional magnetic fields. The rows are a series of snapshots in time.

At low modenumber, m=2, the poloidal and compressional magnetic fields are VAGUELY field-aligned, but mostly they look pretty blobby. The toroidal field, on the other hand, is DEFINITELY resonating along field lines. There's not much SMEAR in L. Everything looks pretty sharp. 

And all of the components are comparably strong, in a hand-wavey sense. Keeping in mind that these magnitudes are shown on a symmetric log scale. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -------------------------------------------------- Large Modenumber Snapshots
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At large modenumber, m=32, the picture changes A LOT. We've still got some smear in the poloidal field. The toroidal mode is still sharp, especially at the outer edge here. The compressional field is comparably very weak. 

(FLIP BACK AND FORTH A BIT)

Remember that the compressional Alfven wave is how energy moves across L-shells. So when the poloidal wave stops being compressional, energy stops moving across field lines. A little bit of that energy manages to tunnel out to a third harmonic at large L, but mostly everything is pretty confined in L. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing I may not have been explicit about earlier is that the driving is delivered purely into the poloidal electric field. We're putting a sinusoidal perturbation the magnitude of the ring current, and leaving its direction alone. 

So the fact that we're seeing any toroidal waves at all tells us that the poloidal and toroidal waves are coupled. 

And it turns out, the poloidal mode actually rotates to the toroidal mode over time. 

Henry Radoski looked at this in 1974. He showed that a poloidal wave will rotate over time to the toroidal mode as a result of the curved geometry. 

Ian Mann looked at the same thing in 1995, and showed that you can get the same effect from a gradient in the Alfven speed. 

Tuna is several decades more realistic than the models used in the past. They used perfectly reflecting boundary conditions, simplified geometries, and so on. 

So let's check their results. Let's integrate all of the energy in the poloidal mode, and all of the energy in the toroidal mode, and plot them, and see what we can see about poloidal-to-toroidal rotation. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------- Integrated Dayside Energy
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This figure may look a little overwhelming, but I promise it's not so bad. 

Each subplot is a different 300 second run. 

Drive frequency is at the top of each column, and the azimuthal modnumber increases as we go down the rows. 

The two runs we looked at snapshots for are in the rightmost column, second from the top and second from the bottom. 

And what we're looking at is, how fast does the red line (the toroidal energy) grow compared to the blue line (the poloidal energy). 

At high modenumber, the red line grows slowest. At m=64, the toroidal energy takes tens of oscillation periods to catch up to the poloidal energy. At m=4, the toroidal energy catches up to the poloidal energy within a single wave period. This is consistent with Mann's work -- he showed that rotation time scales with modenumber. 

We can also see that the asymptotic energy of the system depends on the frequency, which also makes sense. When the driving lines up with the eigenfrequency where it's delivered, we build up energy more effectively. 

At very low modenumber, though, everything gets sorta weird. To get a better sense of this, let's take a look at these same runs from a different angle. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------- Dayside Poloidal Layers
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plot shows the same runs, arranged in the same way. Frequency at the top, modenumber down the side. But instead of integrating all the energy in the entire simulation domain, we're looking just at the energy in the poloidal mode, and we've got it broken down in terms of L. So for each time step, we've computed the mean energy density in each L-shell. That's on the vertical axis. The horizontal axis is time. 

At modenumbers above about 4, we see about what we might have expected from the snapshots we looked at. Low modenumbers are more compressional, so energy is more spread out in L. As modenumber gets higher, the spread gets smaller. 

At very lopw modenumber, though, we see something completely different. At L=5, where we inject the driving, we don't really see any energy buildup. There's a bit of a resonance inside the plasmasphere, where energy gets caught in the potential well. And we have a LOT of energy making a break for the outer boundary. 

This is why the curves on the previous slide looked weird. At high modenumber, we're looking at energy building up in FLRs. At low modenumber, waves are only SORTA guided by the field lines, so these waves are only SORTA FLRs at all. 

It also bears noting -- this will pop up a few times -- that this big buildup of energy in the 19 mHz, m=1 run is likely not physical. There's a third harmonic resonance RIGHT at the outer boundary, so it's probably artificially enhanced by bumping continuously against the boundary condition.

So that was the poloidal energy distribution. Let's look at its toroidal counterpart. These are still the same 28 runs, arranged in the same way. 

Like we saw before, looking at the snapshots, the toroidal mode is a LOT sharper in L than the poloidal mode. The compressional component of the poloidal mode is evanescent at high modenumber, so it does a good IMITATION of a shear Alfven wave, but the toroidal FLR actually IS a shear Alfven wave. 

So we see that the poloidal mode is smeared out across L-shells, and that the energy in the poloidal mode rotates over time to the toroidal mode. But the toroidal energy really only shows up on field lines where the the wave frequency lines up with the local eigenfrequency. 

This matches with past results. Poloidal FLR observations tend to depend only VAGUELY on latitude, or L-shell, which makes sense if those waves are smeared out. Toroidal observations tend to have frequencies that depend strongly on L, which makes sense since those waves only show up at resonant L-shells.
